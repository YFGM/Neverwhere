--- Neverwhere: Arcane Magic and Spellcasting ---

 No fantasy setting is complete without magic spells. Ranging from the humble to the incredible, magic can be the greatest tool, or weapon, that one could wish for. A dedicated wizard can one day perhaps learn to do things that make mere mortals tremble at his might, or destroy himself in the process. For magic is not for the light of heart, it is an ancient, mysterious force that can both grant boon and destruction. So be wary, young arcanist, the path ahead you is long and dangerous.
 This chapter deals with so called Arcane Magic, which is your traditional spellcasting you'd expect to see in a fantasy setting. A magician learns spells that have different effects and uses his own energy to then manifest those spells as he desires. There are other ways to cast magic, too, but those are for other chapters to address.


-- Learning a Spell--

 Before you can even start to learn arcane magic, you must either already have an inborn magic gift, or somehow unlock one. The easiest way to do so is to select the Arcane Gift perk at character creation or afterwards, which awards you Mage Level 1 (See [PERK DOC] for a description of Arcane Gift, and below for an explanation of what Mage Level is).
 To begin learning arcane magic, you must select the Spellcasting perk.

 - Spellcasting -
 Prerequisites: Mage Level 1
 Benefit: You gain 2 spell points to spend on spells.
 Special: This perk may be selected multiple times, it's effect stacks.

 This gives you 2 "Spell Points", which represent your advances in mastering the art of magic. Spell Points can be used to learn new spells, or improve your mastery over already known spells. There are generally two classes of spells: Normal and Difficult. Learning a normal spell costs 2 spell points, learning a difficult one 4. Improving a normal spell costs 1 point, and improving a difficult spell costs 2. This represents how long it takes to improve in such spells, and you can improve your mastery in two normal spells with one perk, or increase your mastery of one spell by two levels. Some spells have prerequisites, such as knowing other spells of similar nature first, or having a certain degree of mastery over magic (See Mage Level below). You can only learn a spell if you fulfill all prerequisites the spell lists.
 You may only learn a spell of which you have a good copy at hand, such as a teacher who already knows the spell or a spellbook (a novel that mentions the use of a spell is NOT enough, it has to be specifically written for the purpose of teaching). As a rule of thumb, one spell point represents two 5-day 8-hour weeks of light magic practice. If no copy of a spell is present, one can attempt to invent a new spell oneself (see Inventing a New Spell in the Advanced Arcanist's Guide to Magic [ADVANCED MAGIC]). 
 When you first learn a spell, it's Success Number (SN) is 10 if it is a normal spell, and 12 if it is a difficult spell, meaning you must roll above that to successfully cast it, including all applicable modifiers (see 'Casting a Spell', below). When first learned, a spell is 'quirky' until you iron out the details automatically in a month, mark such a spell with a 'q' (See 'Quirky Spells', below). For every further spell point (or 2, in case of a difficult spell) you invest into said spell, it's SN decreases by one. Therefor, the lower your SN is on a spell, the better you have mastered it. Once your spell mastery hits SN 8, and every two levels beyond (6, 4, 2 etc), the spell's energy cost is decreased by one to both cast and if applicable maintain (to a minimum of 1). Once your SN hits 8, and every 4 levels beyond (4, 0, -2 etc), the casting time of that spell is either halved, or lowered one level (More than one round->half as many rounds, full round->standard action, it cannot be lowered further, except certain spells, see below). You CAN decrease your SN to 1, 0 or even negative numbers, further lowering the cost of the spell and causing you to be more capable of casting the spell in unfavorable circumstances. A nat 1 always counts as a critical failure, but once your SN hits 2, there are no normal failures anymore, as long as no other penalties exist. A negative total on your casting roll, if below your SN of course, counts as a minor fizzle (See 'Casting a Spell', below).
 To note your spells down on your character sheet use the format:

 [Spell Name]-[SN][q or not]

 For example:

 Fireball-4
 
 Would denote knowing the 'Fireball' spell at SN level 6. We look up that Fireball is a normal difficulty spell, so it took our character 4 Spell Points to bring his Fireball mastery to this level, plus the two Spell Points to learn it. When in combat, he must roll a 7 or better to successfully cast this spell. Since it is a normal spell, he only fizzles in the lower half of the failure range (see 'Casting a Spell', below), meaning on a 2 or 3, while he takes no penalty on a 4 other than wasting his action. On a nat 1, he critically fails as always. We look up that Fireball is a Full Round Action to cast, but since our SN is 4, it is reduced to only a move action (we were only allows to reduce it to a move instead of a standard action because of the spell type, see below), meaning we could theoretically cast 2 in one round (or charge the spell, see 'Casting a Spell'). Additionally due to our good SN, we pay 4 less energy per casting of the spell.


 A spell SN of 12 is considered hardly being able to pull off the spell at all. 10 is considered being a bit clumsy and new to it. 8 is considered having gotten the hang of it very well. 6 or lower denotes mastery of the spell, being quite excellent at it.

- Mage Level -

 Different races and casters have different innate levels of magic manipulation abilities. Some may have the best education and know many spells, but be incapable of casting all but the simplest. Others may have a stunning knack for magic, but be too lazy to learn more about their gifts than necessary. When training and talent combine, a true archmage may emerge. Every character has a 'Mage Level', which is a rough estimate of the magical potential they have, but not their actual skill. Mage Level is sometimes needed to determine whether or not a given character is capable of casting certain very powerful spells. Other than that, the Mage Level functions as a 'multiplier' for the upper limits of spells. For example, if a spell had a limitation of a maximum investment of 5 points of energy, a level 2 mage could invest up to 10, a level 3 up to 15, and so on, increasing the spells strength appropriately. The levels are:

 Level 0: This is the baseline level of Magery that any magical creature possesses. Any creature whose body in some form or way utilizes magic is at least a Level 0 mage. This score allows the character to faintly feel magic as an odd presence or similar, and also makes them vulnerable to slight uneasiness in an anti-magical area. An anti-magic area or a direct Dispel Magic directed at such a character may knock out certain magical based abilities he possesses. Any creature with a supernatural ability has at least this mage level.

 Level 1: Beginning at level 1, we start to speak of a 'Spellcaster'. This is the level of magical aptitude required to utilize spells. A level 0 mage may learn spells, but cannot cast them, for whatever reason. A level 1 mage can feel magic auras more precisely and can differentiate different magic auras with training and concentration. At this level, most spells are available to learn, only a few higher tiered spells being infeasible at this level. Many humans can acquire this level through the Arcane Gift perk, and any monster capable of casting spells also has at least this level.

 Level 2: A level 2 spellcaster is a force to be reckoned with. All but the most powerful and dangerous spells could be unlocked by this level of mage. This level is rare, and usually requires innate talent in magic and years of training to achieve. Only very powerful archmages usually reach this level.

 Level 3 and beyond: Almost no creature can reach beyond level 2 magery, and such creatures are not too properly statted in this system. A level 3 or above mage is capable of insane feats of magical power, baffling lesser creatures with their nigh godlike powers. 

 Humans by default have no mage level (not even 0). If a human learns a magical ability of any kind, they immediately reach mage level 0, and if they select the Arcane Gift perk (or similar), become level 1. It is possible for PCs to reach level 2 magery through years of training, through the Archmage perk.

 - Archmage -
 Prerequisites: At least 40 spells with a SN of 8 or lower (of which at least 5 must be difficult spells, 5 must be of the meta magic college and at least one spell must be SN 0 or lower), The spell 'Enchant' at SN 8 or lower, Three College Masteries, Two School Masteries, Mage Level 1, Thaumatology +8
 Benefit: You have become a paragon of the arcane arts, wielding magic like a paintbrush over the canvas of life. Your mage level increases to 2 (Your catalyst and aspects do not change, if you have multiple types of spellcasting, all increase to level 2), and you are probably renown far and wide for your incredible magical abilities.
 Note: Achieving this level of magical mastery on average would take roughly 15 years of uninterrupted, vigorous training and no small level of talent.

 Some creatures have special forms of magery. The most common types are catalyst based and aspected magery. 
 A catalyst based mage can only cast spells when he has the catalyst in question on hand in working order, usually a certain magical appendage, but there are rumors of rare magic items that can bestow magery on any who wield them, perhaps along with the knowledge of many spells. When a catalyst based mage loses his catalyst for whatever reason, he usually drops to Mage Level 0, but there are some exceptions. See the individual magery description for details. 
 An aspected mage is highly talented with certain types of magic, but either less competent with or wholly incapable of casting spells of different types (Often called a 'limitation'). The drawbacks and pros are discussed individually with each case of aspected magery. For example, a fire elemental mage may be able to cast very powerful fire spells, but no water spells at all.


-- Interlude: Mana --

 All magic, whether wizard's fireball or undead animation, is based on the presence of 'mana', the invisible yet somewhat tangible field of magical energy that permeates the entire world. There are different levels of mana. It usually is rather static in a given area, but some very powerful magical effects can alter the level of mana in an area. Sometimes it also fluctuates naturally. There are several basic levels of mana:

 Extreme Mana: Magical energies are off the chart in this area, and spontaneous manifestations of bizarre and unpredictable magic are bound to be common. Anyone can cast any spell they know, whether they have the required level of magery or their catalyst or not. Even a level 0 mage may cast a spell, at a -5 penalty. Also, completely unknown spells may be cast directly 'from the book' at a -5 penalty, as long as some written copy is present. Any spell known to the caster is cast at +5. Especially adventurous characters may even attempt to manipulate the incredible level of mana through their imagination alone. Such a player describes the action they want to accomplish, the GM finds the most closely suited spell, and the PC then rolls a Will roll with a penalty equal to the energy cost of the closest related spell. A -5 applies if the wanna-be worldshaper is a level 0 mage, +5 if he is level 2 (+10 if level 3, etc). The SN is 12. On a success, the effect manifests. The GM is urged to be cruel and unforgiving on bad rolls and further twist even successful attempts. Anyone casting a spell in such an area regains their spent FP (but not HP!) at the beginning of their next turn. Any spell failure in this area is treated as a critical failure, and actual critical failures create DISASTROUS results. The GM is again urged to be absolutely merciless and creative, a critical fail in an Extreme Magic area is reason enough for a TPK (Total Party Kill). Laws of physics and logic are frequently broken with little regard in such areas, and the GM is at complete liberty to pepper around random magical effects as he wishes. Anyone with at least mage level 0 need not sleep, eat or drink at all in such an area, as their body is charged by the ambient overflow of energy. Actually magical creatures, such as Undead or Fey, go through often spectacularly unpredictable and odd transformations in such areas. Despite how tantalizing the promises of reality being shapeable by imagination like butter, and the rumors of prolonged exposure increasing lifespan and magical ability, are, such levels of magic are incredibly toxic overtime, staying in one for long times makes one very prone to magical (sometimes wondrous, sometimes cancerous) mutations. The random and unpredictable magical effects will surely destroy any mortal that lingers in such an area for too long. Areas like this are incredibly rare and usually short lived, usually manifesting more as sudden eruptions of magic in otherwise less extreme areas, and tearing themselves apart relatively swiftly. 

 Very High Mana: While far less mindbending as Extreme Magic areas, Very High level areas are still rare and wondrous. Random eruptions of bizarre and dangerous magic, along with alien creatures that feed on the ambient energy, lurk in such rare places. Any FP spent on a spell is recovered the round after casting, all spell failures are treated as critical failures and actual critical failures are incredibly disastrous. Level 0 mages or above need not sleep, eat or drink in such areas. Such areas usually exist as small pockets within larger high mana zones, such as where ley lines (somewhat like invisible rivers of mana) intersect. 

 High Mana: Still an incredibly rare occurrence, High Mana zones are places of great wonder. Many magical creatures naturally flock to such areas, and wondrous arcane vegetation grows in the lifegiving mana. The first level to not have random inhospitable bouts of magical destruction, such an area is usually rather tame in sense of spontaneous magic, but it's inhabitants usually aren't. Anyone with level 0 magery or above need only eat, sleep and drink half as much as normal, and ages half as fast as well. Most high magical creatures such as Fey find such areas far more comfortable to live in. Despite lack of random eruptions, such areas often have certain unique and bizarre rules, such as a different speed of time flowing or gravity.

 Normal Mana: The usual level of mana found throughout the world, all standard rules apply.

 Low Mana: In areas where the effects of mana are weak, all spells are cast at a -5 penalty, but critical failures have little or no effect at all. This side effect can also be useful for testing out new and possibly dangerous spells.

 No Mana: Also sometimes called an Anti-Magic Zone, such areas contain no mana at all. Spellcasting is impossible, and permanent spells and enchanted items cease to function, but resume functioning when taken outside such an area. Temporary or lasting spells are dispelled upon entering such an area. No magic can be cast into or out of such an area, and magical natural abilities, such as a dragon's fire, cease to function as well. Any creature of level 0 magery or higher will feel somewhat uncomfortable in such an area, and may fall ill and die if kept in such an area for a very long time. Highly Magical creatures such as Undead go into a form of suspended animation when entering such areas, treat them as unconscious. Some such creatures also take damage while in such areas, but if removed, they will reawaken (Assuming they have not accrued too much damage). Such areas are usually artificial in nature, created by powerful spellcasters to contain dangerous items or creatures or as a defense mechanism. Natural dead magic zones exist too, but they are quite rare and usually very small and inconspicuous.

 One usually cannot directly feel the level of mana one is currently in, but a perceptive mage can feel the shift from moving from one area to another (an arbitrarily good perception roll can be called by the GM). Usually, moving from a low to higher mana area manifests as a more giddy, exciting but also headache inducing feeling, while moving from higher to lower areas tends to be calming and relaxing but dulling.

 Not all mana is equal though, sometimes there can be so called 'Aspected Mana'. Such areas have a particular affinity to certain spells or effects. A fire aspected area may function as a Very High Mana area when fire spells are cast in it, but as a Low or even No Mana zone when an ice spell is attempted. Other areas have more generic effects. Certain ley lines of mana may have more mutagenic and 'chaotic' mana, creating dangerous and monster stalked lands. Other ley lines may have especially tame and predictable mana, more suitable for orderly existence, while again others may really improve plant growth. Some areas also have trademark effects, like having a tendency to turn anyone that enters them into toads. Such areas can in theory be created artificially, but the vast majority is natural and random in nature, and one can never predict when a ley line might change it's course or effects, making magic a fickle mistress never to get too comfortable with, since she may turn on you at any moment. 


-- Casting a Spell --

 You must know a spell before attempting to cast it, unless you have some form of magic item that allows you to use the spell (See [MAGIC ITEMS]). When you decide to cast a spell, you concentrate for the number of rounds or actions specified in the description of the spell and modified by your mastery of it. During this time, your concentration must remain unbroken (See 'Concentration').
 If your concentration remains till the end of the casting time, roll a d20 like a normal skill roll, modified for any applicable Perks or environmental conditions and using your Int modifier, against the SN of your spell. If you roll higher than your SN with modifiers, your spell is successful. You lose the applicable amount of FP and HP and the effect takes place immediately. Any roll below is a failure, with a roll in the 'upper half' of the failure range, rounded down, causing a 'mild fizzle', which costs you nothing, and the 'lower half' causing a 'major fizzle', which costs you 1 FP and causes your spell to do something mild but very annoying, such as a fireball making you smoke profusely for no damage. A nat 20 is always a critical success, causing your spell to function extremely well and costing you no energy. The GM is the judge on what 'extremely well means', but a general double effectiveness is recommended. A nat 1 is always a critical failure, no matter modifiers. This causes your spell to backfire spectacularly, costing you it's full normal energy cost and doing something BAD. The GM may think of something creative, have a harmful spell go against the caster or his allies, have a beneficial spell go for the enemies, or just go with a generic 1d2 damage per point of energy spent against the caster.

- Concentration -

 While casting your spell, you must retain full concentration on your spell. If you are in some form seriously distracted, such as by being knocked over, injured, grappled, sexed up, slapped etc, you must make a successful Will roll against the SN of your spell to maintain concentration. You must repeat this roll each round the distraction continues, and CAN be forced to do this roll multiple times per round if multiple sources of distraction exist. Any injury received during a round gives a -1 penalty on this roll per HP lost in this round. Modifiers for pain and disabling injuries apply as well. Some spells and effects deliberately cause distraction, and cause different penalties to concentration.

- Caster and Subject -

 The 'caster' of a spell is the person who is trying to manifest the spell. The 'subject' or 'target' is the person, place or thing in the widest sense that is to be affected by the spell. If you are casting a spell on yourself, you are both caster and subject. A subject can be another being, an item or even a patch of ground, depending on the spell. If the subject of a spell is a place and the range is "touch", a caster may extend his hand over the area or touch the ground, as appropriate.

- Time Required -

 Most spells require a full round action to cast, but some also are longer or shorter. If no duration is given, assume a spell takes a full round action to cast. Your spell manifests immediately (if successful) at the end of this time, and actions can be taken after each other as normal (a move action could be taken before or after a standard action spell, but not both, as usual). A standard action or longer spell provokes attacks of opportunity in combat, but quicker spells don't. A multiple round spell provokes attacks of opportunity every round the caster is concentrating. You may 'abort' a spell that is being cast at any time with no penalty, but must begin the spell from the beginning when reattempted.

- Energy Cost -

 Each spell has an 'Energy Cost'. When you cast a spell, you must pay this cost in either FP or HP. The better you master a spell, the less it costs. For every 2 by which your SN is below 10 for a spell, it's energy cost is reduced by 1, the same applies to maintaining a spell. Calculate the FULL cost (modified for area or subject size, for example) before applying this discount. Your spell still is drawing energy, but you have become so adept at it that you are supplying the energy directly from the mana field around you. Energy Cost is usually payed in FP, but you may also burn HP instead. Every HP spent gives a -1 on your roll due to discomfort (Exception: Necromancy spells do not have this restriction and often require HP mandatorily). You may spend as many HP as you wish, but if you fail a roll to resist death, you fall unconscious instead of casting the spell. Using HP in spells is both dangerous and inefficient, but can be necessary when badly fatigued and in a dangerous situation.

- Magic Rituals -

 Every spell requires some form of ritual to complete. For non human races, the rituals needed may be different. The complexity of the ritual is dependent on your SN:

 11 or higher: You must have all four limbs free and need to strike certain uncomfortable and elaborate poses while mumbling to yourself to get it right. You cannot cast such a spell while holding anything in your hands or if your legs are tied together or similar, and armor penalty applies to your roll to cast.

 9-10: You can cast the spell with one hand occupied but must still take on a slightly uncomfortable pose. While holding an object in any hand, you take a -2 on casting, and armor check penalty applies.

 7-8: You need only make a small flick of your hand or similar to cast such a spell correctly. You take no penalty for holding an item and any armor check penalty is halved (minimum 0, round down).

 6 or lower: You need no ritual other than to stare firmly into space. You take no penalties for equipment at all.

 Most casters are taught to use poses to better remember spells, since muscle memory really enhances ones ability to learn spells quickly. This is an ancient technique that has been practiced for generations, and is the reason spellcasters usually don't wear armor. You may opt to leave out such poses, but you take a -6 on casting due to the much higher difficulty of remembering the exact thought processes without muscle memory aid. Some casters also learn to use vocals to further enhance their spellcasting memory, which looks and sounds silly, but can give a bonus.

 - Vocal Casting -
Prerequisites: At least one spell at SN 8 or lower
Benefit: You have trained in using vocals to help you get spells down right. Whenever you clearly speak or shout certain words (which can be anything you desire for that specific spell) while casting a spell, you gain a +1 on the roll to succeed in casting.

- Magic Ingredients -

 Some (usually powerful) spells require material components to function correctly. You must have the required items in a hand or be touching them to use them. Unless otherwise specified, the ingredients are wholly consumed after casting, leaving nothing but dust. Attempting to cast a spell without it's ingredients incurs a penalty depending on the spell, anywhere from -3 to -20, or making it flat out impossible to cast. It is sometimes possible to invent new versions of a spell without these requirements, but such a version is usually much harder to cast and less potent anyways. There also exist some 'generic' magic ingredients, that can be added optionally to a variety of spells to increase their potency or ease of casting (see 'Magical Substances', coming sometime maybe[).

- Spending More Energy -

 If a spell allows you to spend more than the normal amount of energy to enhance it, you may spend freely from the minimum to the maximum allowed cost on the spell, as long as you can afford it. If it specifies no upper limit, you may spend as much energy on it as you wish. This is calculated before any applicable modifiers for subject size or similar. You can exceed the upper limit of a limited spell if your level of magery is above 1, in which case the upper limit is multiplied with your level of magery.

- Cooperative Magic -

 If you know a spell at SN 8 or better, and you have a group of willing assistants, you may opt to cast a the spell by leading your assistants in an elaborate ritual that maximizes the spell's power. Such cooperative (sometimes called ceremonial) magic, is very time-consuming, but lets you cast much more powerful spells than you could on your own. 
 When you perform a spell cooperatively, multiply it's casting time by 10. You must have assistants to perform cooperative magic. Low SN does NOT reduce casting time, energy cost or penalty from equipment and armor. If a participating spellcaster knowing the spell knows it only as quirky, the quirk subtly affects the final outcome depending on how much energy of the final spell was given by a quirky caster (GM decides). Energy cost does not change, but your friends can supplement energy as follows (all maximums are multiplied with the assistant's magery level):

 * Each spellcaster (Mage Level 1 or higher) who knows the spell at SN 8 or better: as much energy as he wishes to contribute.
 * Each spellcaster that knows the spell at worse than SN 8: Up to 3 points.
 * Each spellcaster that does not know the spell: Up to 2 points.
 * Each unskilled spectator who supports the casting (by chanting, holding candles, just providing positive emotional support etc): 1 point, to a maximum of 100 from all spectators.
 * Each spectator who OPPOSES the casting: -5 points to a maximum penalty of -100 from all spectators! If this prevents you from having enough energy available to cast your spell, the ritual fails (costing you and assistants the full amount of energy invested anyhow), but you do not know why.

 The sum of the energy from all sources represents the total energy available. If this exceeds the cost to cast the spell, you receive a bonus on your roll to cast: +1 for 20% energy beyond the casting cost, +2 for 40%, +3 for 60%, +4 for 100% and another +1 per additional 100% of the required energy. 
 At the end of the ritual, make a roll to cast the spell. Apply all usual modifiers for that spell and any bonuses from extra energy. Regardless of the outcome, all contributed energy is spent when you roll the dice. Cooperative magic may not be assisted by magical means such as Wish, Luck or Bless (But Greater Wish DOES work). In general, magic cannot affect or predict the outcome of cooperative magic.
 Once the spell is cast, participants can continue to provide energy to maintain the spell. The composition of the group may change, as long as the ritual continues uninterrupted. The ritual leader must always be alive, if he perishes, the ritual spell is dispelled, but not if he is merely sleeping or unconscious. Otherwise, whenever a maintenance cost accrues, and at least one spellcaster knowing the spell at SN 8 or lower is present and conscious, any participants may pay the maintenance cost. New members can be initiated into the ritual by any such spellcaster. Thus, cooperative magic allows you to maintain a spell indefinitely, if done right.
 A participant must support the ceremony of his own free will. A mind-controlled subject cannot focus sufficient will to contribute energy.

Example: Banishing a Shoggoth

 In the grim dark future there is only - you know the drill. In a future world of Fort Nowhere, the by now growing city faces one of it's greatest threats yet: From beyond the stars, a terrible beast has fallen to earth: A Shoggoth. And it will not rest until every sapient creature is wiped from the face of the planet. Scouts, at least those that came back sane, or at all, report that the lumbering monstrosity is headed straight for Fort Nowhere, and there isn't much time left.
 To combat this threat, High Arcanist Aris calls together the Council of Archmages to formulate a plan to defeat the beast. They conclude after a few spectacularly gory attempts to harm it that they cannot defeat a creature of this power, but instead will attempt to combine their arcane powers to banish it back to whence it came. Aris, long the somewhat unhinged destroyer of all monsters, knows the Banish spell at SN 4, the best of anyone present, and so, will lead the circle in it's attempt to cast away the creature from beyond time.
 Other than Aris, only archmage Caleb, his apprentices Tito and Avrin, archmage Diana and bounty hunter Jason know the Banish spell. Sadly, Tito and Jason only know the spell at SN 10. Additionally, Aris enlists the help of archmage Arthos, archmage Bob and every half way competent mage in town (70 mage level 1, none of which know Banish). Finally, he recruits 100 non spellcasters of the town militia to aid the ritual in menial ways.
 As the Shoggoth approaches in the distance, the huge group of 178 people gather to perform the ritual. The spectators make a large ring around a podium, and in that ring, the mages, with Jason, Avrin and Tito, form a smaller ring, and on the podium stand the 5 archmages with Aris at the center, elevated to have a clear view of the approaching horror.
 Banish has a casting time for Aris of 1 standard action, but normally it would be 1 full round action. Since he is casting it ceremoniously, the time to cast the spell increases to 1 minute. The default cost of Banish is 5, modified for the size of the target, and is resisted by Will. We omit range penalties for simplicity's sake. The Shoggoth is about 30m long, so the base cost increases to 25. While Aris may be able to barely cast this spell on his own, he can't take any chances, and assumes the monster will have an absurdly high resistance to his magic. He is correct in his assumption, since Shoggoths have +19 Will and Magic Resistance 5 (Giving Aris -5 on his roll for purpose of resistance). A Banish spell cast only by him is unlikely to be powerful enough.
 Aris begins the ritual. The spectators collectively donate 100 FP to the casting, the mages 140 FP, Jason and Tito 6 FP, Arthos and Bob 8 FP (Since they are mage level 2, they can donate twice as much as usual), and finally Aris, Caleb, Avrin and Diana may contribute as much as they like, totaling at 105 FP. Altogether, Aris now has 359 worth of FP to cast his spell.
 The first 100%, up to 50, give him +4 to his roll, and every additional 25 will give him another +1, for a total of +16 to his roll. Aris automatically succeeds at casting his spell as long as he doesn't roll a nat 1 (which at such a powerful spell, could be quite catastrophic), and the Shoggoth then rolls Will against his margin of success - 5.
 Aris rolls a 16, for a total of 23 to resist, and the Shoggoth rolls an 8 for a total of 27, resisting the spell despite Aris' good roll and the combined effort of the whole community. The entire town slowly descends into pure dread as they realize their most powerful of spells harmlessly deflects off the unspeakable horror, hardly making it flinch. Is this the end of Fort Nowhere?
 Aris unsheathes his sword, arm crackling with electricity as he spits onto the ground, "I guess we're doing this the old fashioned way..."


- Durations of Spells and Maintaining -

 There are five different types of duration for spells:

 Instantaneous spells produce an effect and then end immediately. Some instantaneous spells leave behind permanent changes, a petrification spell for example may leave behind a stone statue. The difference is that an instantaneous spell cannot be dispelled, the statue said petrification spell left is truly just a statue, not an enchantment lasting and making the unfortunate subject a statue. Once such a spell runs it's course, it's effects are to stay.

 Temporary spells require a continued expenditure of energy to maintain. If a given spell has a cost to maintain, it is most likely a temporary spell. At the end of each listed duration, you may pay the maintenance cost, modified for low SN and other modifiers as appropriate. If you do, the spell's effect endures for another listed interval. You may continue to maintain a spell as long as you have the energy to spend, and as long as you are conscious, you always know when your spells need maintenance and may do so. You cannot maintain a spell while asleep, and you can't "hand off" a spell to someone else. You can maintain a spell without having to concentrate, unless the spell requires manipulation and change, for example to maneuver a levitating object. Spells like this require you to take an appropriate action to concentrate, and modifiers apply as under Concentration. If you fail, the spell persists, but is in the exact same state as it was before. You may then attempt to change it again next round as appropriate. On a critical failure, your spell ends. You may not modify a spell after being cast without recasting it unless stated in the spell description. The sole exception to this rule is that you may shrink the affected area, only paying the maintenance cost for the smaller area, but you may not re-expand the area. You may even cast spells while temporary spells are active, but you take a -1 penalty for each temporary spell you have cast that is acting, -3 if you are actively concentrating on one. Temporary spells are vulnerable to dispelling.

 Lasting spells do not require maintenance, and generally last until they are used, but have a limited effective duration. The classic example are contingency spells. Lasting spells are vulnerable to dispelling.

 Permanent spells create a magical effect that feeds itself and lasts indefinitely. Zombie is a good example: The magical animation persists until the physical body of the zombie is destroyed. A permanent spell is not dispelled when it is brought into a No Mana zone, but it does cease to function while in such an area. It resumes functioning once leaving the area. Most permanent spells are subject to dispelling, with a few exceptions, and those that aren't are subject to Remove Curse. All permanent spells are vulnerable to disjunction.

 Enchantment spells are even more durable than permanent spells, creating an enduring magical effect that can create other magical effects in turn. Enchantments cannot be dispelled but only suppressed temporarily by dispelling, and are suspended in no mana zones. They are vulnerable to disjunction.


 You may always set a lower duration than what is listed in the spell, but if you want to end a spell suddenly before it's time, you must spend one FP or HP to do so, regardless of the spell or skill level. You cannot end Enchantment spells without destroying them either physically or by disjunction.



- Interlude: Anti Magic, Dispelling, Remove Curse and Disjunction -

 There are a few different ways one can combat and remove a magical effect, and their effectiveness depends on what you are fighting. You could take an offending magical effect into a no mana zone, which will dispel temporary and lasting effects 100% of the time, and at least contain permanent and enchantment effects. This is because temporary and lasting effects constantly draw energy from the mana field to remain stable, and destabilize and drift away like a puff of metaphysical smoke when their 'fuel' goes out. 
 Permanent and enchantment effects though have an actual physical element placed specifically in the spell to resist lack of mana and resume tapping of magical energy once it is available. This is why permanent and enchantment spells almost always have material components. 
 'Dispelling' a spell is injecting a chaotic surge of magic into an effect to attempt to destabilize and neutralize it. This is usually resolved by the attempted dispeller rolling against the caster of the to be dispelled spell (See 'Dispel Magic' for more info). Some spells, namely enchantments and curses, are resistant to this kind of interference. Enchantments are designed to have a very strong physical aspect, meaning even if they are dispelled, the physical component of the spell will basically 'recast itself' soon after. 
 Most permanent spells are not as sophisticatedly designed to resist dispelling, but so called 'Curses' do resist dispelling. Curses act on an odd, metaphysical level that is poorly understood. Rather than directly affecting a target with a direct magical effect, a curse lingers in a ethereal way around the subject, some say latched onto their soul. As such, there is no direct magical effect to be seen at all at first glance, and a curse as such can only be detected and dispelled by spells specifically designed to find and neutralize them (see 'Remove Curse' and 'Detect Curse'), but otherwise function as potent (and universally malevolent) permanent spells. 
 The final level of anti magic is 'disjunction', which is more an art than a spell. In this technique, a spell is meticulously analyzed and destroyed from the roots up, every physical and magical aspect individually targeted and undone. A mage must both know the spell 'Disjunction' AND the spell he is trying to disjunct to even attempt such a feat. A very skilled thaumaturge can also sometimes try a "blind" disjunction. See the spell description for 'Disjunction' for more info.

- Spell Endurance -

 Most spells resist other spells by using their caster's skill or similar. Some temporary or lasting spells, however, can slowly be whittled away by continued assault. These spells are said to have an 'Endurance', which is similar to HP for spells in a way. Each spell with Endurance individually discusses how it works, but the usual level of Endurance of a spell is the Spell Points invested into it + caster's int modifier + margin of success on casting.

- One Try Spells -

 Some spells are marked as "One Try", which means that for any given subject, you only have one chance to affect them. If your spell fails to affect a subject, that subject becomes immune to the spell as cast by you. Some spells only permit a single try per a time period such as "one try per week". If there is no time interval given, the caster may only attempt it a single time and never again.

- Quirky Spells -

 When you first learn a new spell, it is prone to have a few oddities about it. The spell functions as it should, but has at least one harmless but annoying or odd side effect. This can be anything from a fireball making you smell terribly of sulfur for a minute to a flight spell making your head sprout a few feathers each time. Think of something amusing or annoying for your spell to do. A quirk should never directly cause harm or be beneficial, but it may be very inconvenient. This quirk disappears on it's own within a month, you may still opt to have it occur in the finished spell if you are so inclined, but again, you may not make it something useful to make a spell more powerful sneakily.


-- The types of Magic --

 Spells are generally defined by their College, School and Class.

- Colleges of Magic -

 A college of magic is a collection of spells that have a common theme, such as Fire, Water, Mind-Controlling, Plants, etc, and are often taught as syllabuses at magical universities. The more powerful spells of a college usually have the less powerful ones as prerequisites. Some spells fall into more than one college, this is only important when counting prerequisites. The colleges are designed smartly over many generations by wizards, powerful spells and the appropriate 'stepping stone' spells being grouped together into such colleges. As such, most wizards only specialize in a few colleges to master the more powerful spells more quickly, but you may learn spells from as many colleges as you wish as long as you fulfill the prerequisites.

- Schools of Magic -

 Thaumaturges classify magic into 8 "Schools" of magic based on their underlying way of functioning. The schools are: Conjuration (The magic of summoning and moving), Divination (The magic of sensing and predicting), Enchantment (The magic of mind and emotion manipulation), Evocation (The magic of raw energies), Illusion (The magic of fooling the senses), Meta (The magic of magic itself), Vitamancy (The magic of life, such as healing, it's darker cousin, Necromancy, falls into the same school interestingly, so good healers make good necromancers and vice versa) and Transmutation (The magic of changing one thing into another). These schools are rarely taught as a whole, since the spells themselves are very different in execution and effect inside a school, but the theoretical, underlying mechanics of such spells are similar. As such, a trained thaumaturge can learn to use schools to further his talent in specific areas (Represented through School Focus perks). Sometimes, mana is also aspected towards or against such schools, a Necromancy aspected high mana area is something terrifying.

- Classes of Magic -

 Each spell falls into one or more "classes" which determines how it works mechanically in play. Classes are not really used to discuss magic IC, usually colleges and schools are used amongst professionals, and laymen just describe spells ad hoc anyways. These classes are not mutually exclusive, except where otherwise noted.

 - Regular Spells -
 Most spells fall into this class. These spells have one subject that is assumed to be not larger than 2 meters in his longest dimension (A human is roughly 0.5mx1.8m or so). The cost of such a spell is multiplied by the target's size in meters closest exponent of 2. So a 2m target takes normal energy, a 2-4m one twice, a 4-8m triple, 8-16m quadruple, and so on. There is no discount for small targets.
 Regular spells work best if you can see or touch your target. If you cannot touch your target, you take a -1 penalty to your casting roll per meter you are away from it. Use the distance at the time of rolling the dice. You need not directly see a target, a mirror or even a life detection spell is enough. 
 If you cannot touch or see a subject, such as if you are using a Life Sensing spell, you take an additional -5 penalty to your spell roll. You may attempt to cast such a spell without anything but a very good guess that someone is exactly where you think they are, with a tolerance radius of no more than a meter or two. For example, you could say "the person directly behind this door" after hearing shuffling on the other side or "my friend George, who I know is in the room behind this door somewhere". 
 If your prediction is relatively close to the truth (GM's decision), you take the normal -5 penalty for not seeing and normal distance penalties and may roll your spell. If your prediction is false, roll anyways, but any success is a mild fizzle, and any failure or critical failure is a critical failure. A critical success either has the spell target the best thing the GM could see the spell realistically targeting, or just causes a mild fizzle. No physical barriers affect a Regular Spell, and the spell always hits it's target unless it backfires somehow. 
 Usually, a successful touch attack against an enemy allows you to cast a regular spell on him without distance penalty. You still provoke an attack of opportunity if your casting time is a standard action or more. If your spell has a casting time of more than one full round action, you have to make the touch attack at the end of the casting time (note that after concentrating for a full round action, you may only take one one meter step! So make sure your enemy remains nearby...or you have a fried to throw you).


 - Area Spells -
 An area spell affects an area in space rather than a single target. An area spell extends outwards from one point in space, usually the ground, extending upwards 4 meters. A few area spells work differently, see the individual descriptions. The area radius determines the energy cost, but not the SN. The cost listed for an Area spell is it's "base cost", which is then multiplied by the radius of the desired effect in meters. So a one meter radius would cost the base cost, a 2 meter radius twice etc. Fractions of such an area always cost at least 1 energy point (before applying skill based reduction, remember). Some area spells specify a minimum cost, which you must always pay.
 An area spell affects EVERYONE within it's radius, unless you decide to leave out certain parts of an area. You may leave "holes" in such an area as you wish, but the cost is always the same as if the whole area were affected. You may only leave such holes if your SN for the spell is 8 or lower.
 If you cannot touch any edge of the spell's effect, apply the distance in meters to the nearest edge as a penalty to your roll.
 Otherwise, Area spells function like Regular Spells.

 - Melee Spells -
 Melee spells "charge" your hand  or magic staff with harmful energies that affect the first target you strike. These spells require two rolls, one to cast the spell, and one to hit the target in melee combat with your hand  or staff. Casting a melee spell functions similar to any other spell. Concentrate for the required casting time, roll the dice and then pay the energy cost. If you succeed, you charge your hand  or staff with the spell. On your next action, you must either hold your spell or attack with it.
 If you decide to hold your spell, your hand  or staff remains "charged". This costs no energy and requires no roll. You cannot use any other spell while holding a melee spell. You can do any other action you wish, but an attack with your hand or staff will discharge the spell. If you wish, you can allow a melee spell you are holding to evaporate at any time harmlessly as a free action. A melee spell cast on a staff persists for as long as you wield the staff. If you lose hold of your staff, even for an instant, the spell drains away harmlessly. If someone grabs your staff and tries to wrench it away, though, if you resist it counts as an attack and your opponent instantly suffers the effect of the melee spell.
 To attack with a melee spell, you simply roll a normal attack with your hand or staff. If you hit, you deal normal damage and your spell affects your enemy. If you miss, your spell remains untriggered and you can try against next round. DR protects normally against some Melee spells, not at all against others, depending on the spell and DR in question. Some Melee spells also are touch spells, meaning they target touch AC (not counting armor and certain other bonuses) instead of normal AC. Meaning if you attack an enemy in melee, fail to pierce their main AC, but succeed in beating their touch AC, your spell discharges without added melee damage. Some melee spells also can be resisted, as described under Resisted Spells, requiring a second spell roll to overcome the enemy's resistance.
 Unlike most other spells, the minimum casting time for a Melee Spell you can reach is a move action. This means if you know a melee spell sufficiently well (usually SN 4), you could cast the spell and attack in the same round. A melee spell cast as a move action does NOT provoke an attack of opportunity.

- Interlude: Magic Staffs -

 A "magic staff" or "wizard's staff" is as common a trope as any, and refers in this system to any wand or staff imbued with the ability to extend your reach for the purpose of casting spells, giving three main benefits:

 * Touching a subject with your staff lets you cast spells on that subject at NO distance penalty. This is useful in situations where you have to cast a spell on a subject you cannot directly touch with your hand (for example casting a healing spell at a comrade caught beneath rubble). 
 * Pointing with a staff reduces the effective range to calculate modifiers for distance by the length of the staff. This is valuable for regular spells, as a one meter staff shaves off a -1 and an unwieldy two meter staff would even shave off -2! You can point as part of the ritual to cast a spell, tell your GM you are pointing at your target before beginning casting.
 * A staff can carry a melee spell, allowing you to fight with it instead of getting your hands dirty.

 You may also further enchant or enhance your staff however you want, such as attuning it to enhance certain spells, adding defensive enchantments or self powered attacks, even adding a halberd head works as long as you leave some of the core body free at the top to touch a potential melee spell victim with. A personal staff counts as "Very Good" material for enchanting, no matter what it is made of, but only for it's creator. For many wizards, their staff is a very personal and treasured item they put a lot of work and love into. Creating a staff requires a suitable carved item of once living material (wood is the most common, but bone, coral, ivory or similar work just as well) and knowledge of the "Wizard's Staff" spell. Casting such spell on the staff requires certain herbal unguents and a week of work, as described in the spell. Any spellcaster may only have one staff enchanted at a given time and an individual staff can only be used by it's creator.

 - Missile Spells -
 Missile Spells encompass the usual long-distance "projectiles" and "bolt" spells such as Fireball and Lightning Bolt (but not Magic Missile, which is a regular spell). Casting a missile spell requires two rolls, one spell roll to cast the spell, and one ranged attack roll to hit the target.
 You cast a missile spell not unlike any other spell, concentrating the required duration and then rolling success. If successful, you may invest one point of energy per mage level into the spell that appears in your hand (some missile spells also allow you to invest more than one point of energy). On your next appropriate action (meaning if the spell is a full round action to cast, next turn, if it's a standard action, next turn, but if it's a move action, it can be done within the same round if you have an action left) you may opt to make an attack with it, hold it, or enlarge it. If you decide to enlarge it, you concentrate the same amount of time as you were required to to cast it, and at the end of that time invest an amount of energy up to the spells initial cost multiplied by your mage level. This does not require a roll.
 On your action after that, you have the same options: attack, hold or enlarge. On your fourth action, you may only attack or hold. You cannot spend more than three actions building up a Missile spell. Once you stop enlarging a missile spell, you may "hold" it, ready to attack. You do not have to launch the missile until you want to. While holding a missile spell, you may move and act normally, even attack with any limb not holding the spell (So you could attack with your primary hand if you charge your secondary hand). You cannot cast another spell, though, until the spell is launched. If you are injured while holding a missile spell, you must roll a concentration roll to keep your spell, otherwise it immediately affects you!
 When you are ready to attack, roll a standard ranged attack roll (modified for specialty in missile spells as appropriate), which is subject to normal modifiers for target size, range etc. If a missile spell does not list a range, assume it is 30m. Once launched, the missile flies in a straight line to the target. Physical barriers affect it just as they would any projectile. If you hit your target, he is affected by the spell, normally taking 1d6 damage per point of energy invested or similar. DR of the appropriate type can protect against this damage of course.
 If needed, you can let a missile spell dissipate harmlessly as a free action, or "drop it" to your feet. It doesn't harm you if dropped (unless it is explosive or similar), but it DOES harm whatever is under you normally.
 Unlike most other spells, the minimum casting time for a Missile Spell is a move action.

 - Blocking Spells -
 Blocking spells are unusual in that their casting times are all an Immediate Action, meaning they can be cast even if it is not your turn. These spells are used to defend against some form of attack usually. You may only cast ONE blocking spell per round, no matter how skilled you are. You cannot attempt a blocking spell against a critical hit.
 If you attempt to cast a blocking spell, you immediately lose concentration on any spells, exactly as if you had failed a concentration check. Melee spells and missile spells remain held, but you may not further enlarge a missile spell afterwards.
 Blocking spells also do NOT get any energy reduction from low SN.

 - Information Spells -
 Information spells, as the name implies, help you gain knowledge. Some function at touch, others at long distances. Most information spells have very specific rules, so read their descriptions carefully. When you use an information spell, ideally the GM rolls for you in secrete. If your roll succeeded, your GM reveals the desired information. The better the roll, the better the information. If the spell fails, the GM will say that you sense nothing. On a critical failure, the GM must LIE to you! Regardless of the outcome, you must always pay the full energy cost, unlike with other spells.
 Most information spells generally only allow one attempt per day per caster or so, with some exceptions. Except where otherwise noted, information spells are generally instantaneous. They grant a short insight of knowledge and cannot be maintained.

 NOTE: Information spells can be pretty difficult, especially outside of PnP. While a "sense life" spell or such is cool, spells that recover legends or that allow viewing of far away or hidden things can severely unbalance the game by allowing power gamers to claim meta knowledge because they "were spying with an information spell" or similar. Be warned when allowing powerful information spells into your campaign.

- Interlude: Long Distance Modifiers -

Long distance spells such as many information or teleportation spells would be rather useless if they had the usual -1 per meter restriction, and as such they are noted as using "long distance modifiers" which appear below:

200m   No penalty
500m   -1
1km    -2
3km    -3
10km   -4
30km   -5
100km  -6
300km  -7
1000km -8

And an additional -2 per factor of 10.

--

 - Resisted Spells -
 Some spells can be resisted by the subject. The subject may resist even if he is unconscious, and he attempts so automatically (inborn unconscious resistance to foreign magical influence). A conscious subject aware that something is happening may choose to not resist. Anyone unaware or unfamiliar with what is happening attempts to resist automatically.
 To resolve a resisted spell, you first cast your spell normally. If you fail, the spell fails normally and the subject notices nothing. If you succeed, note your margin of success (So if you had SN 8, and you roll with modifiers a 15, your margin of success would be 7). The subject then attempts to make a resistance roll with whichever attribute the spell specifies, such as Will, against 10+ your margin of success - the target's magic resistance. If the subject ties or comes above, he resists the spell, the spell has no effect, but you must still pay the full cost. The subject will feel a slight physical or mental shock (depending on what the spell targeted), but nothing else. If he fails, the spell affects him normally. You know whether your target resisted your spell or not.
 An area resisted spell functions similar, note your margin of success to determine the SN for all subjects to resist against.

 - Enchanting Spells -
 Enchanting spells are used to make or unmake magic items, and follow special rules described under 'Magic Items'[.

 - Special Spells -
 Some spells have wholly unique rules, read their descriptions on how to handle them.
