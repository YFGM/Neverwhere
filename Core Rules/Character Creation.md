# Neverwhere: Character Creation

 Probably the most central aspect of playing Neverwhere is your Player Character (or PC). Your character is your avatar of sorts, you will roleplay as him, plan his activities, go on adventures with him and so on. If you haven't done so yet, and maybe are not sure if Neverwhere is for you yet, read the "Living Life" document before beginning here! [LIVING LIFE]
 Creating your character is pretty simple, and we will go through it step by step. A character has 3 (and a half) main categories we have to determine: Primary Attributes, Secondary Attributes and Perks (and Skills).

## Step 0: Come up wih a Character

 Before even looking at mechanics, you have to come up with what kind of character you want to play. Who is your character? Where is he from? What abilities should he have? How is his demeanor? It's advisable to take down at least a few bullet points for your own use on the most important aspects of your character. Your choice of gender has no effect on your character's stats. Don't worry too much about how certain skillsets may or may not work with the rules just yet, just write it down as if you were brainstorming for a novel you want to write.
 Be sure to be familiar with the setting you are playing in, and design your character to fit that setting. It may be very inappropriate to make a silly comedic relief character in a survival horror game, and similarly inappropriate to make a gritty survival horror character in a silly comedy game! You should show the basic gist of your character to veteran players of the game you wish to join, or the Over GM. They can surely point out if any parts of your character are unfitting for the game. Don't take this as negative criticism, remember that creating an inappropriate character can ruin the fun of other people!
 From author to reader, I advise that if you are new to a game or not very experienced with RP to make a character as agreeable as possible. Good hearted characters are rewarding to play, are unlikely to cause grief to other characters and make GMs' lives much easier. Don't worry about adding too much depth to begin with, that can always still evolve during gameplay. Try to make a character that has a few interesting character traits, but at heart is a decent person and not too complicated. Often, less is more.

 Example: To go along with this, we shall create a character too. I find a game group I'd like to join and start working on a character concept. The setting is a typical Neverwhere style fantasy survival horror, a group of people are isolated in a dangerous wilderness haunted by everything from wolves, over dragons to eldritch horrors. The setting is quite gritty, violence is common placed. With this information I decide to play a grizzled spellsword. I decide to play a male human, since that fits my character and is what I can identify with. My spellsword will be a practical, no-nonsense, can-do-will-do kind of guy that gets things done and doesn't back down from danger. He is fearless to the point of psychopathy, and considers being capable of slaying powerful foes to be amongst the greatest virtues a man can have. As such, he studies the art of killing and hunting for the majority of his free time. He fights with a blend of offensive magic and swordplay, focusing on devastating precise attacks rather than endurance. He makes his fortune either by selling what he hunts or hiring himself out as a bodyguard. He has a sharp wit and eye, always alert. Whenever a problem presents itself, he tries to solve it as quickly and effectively as possible, by whatever means necessary. He is not mean, cruel or even unlikable, if one can tolerate his attitude. He simply believes in the virtue of strength, and does not tolerate enemies. He has no wish to torture or inflict harm on innocents, or even enemies, he just wishes them to stop existing as quickly and painlessly as possible. This feeling doesn't extend to beasts though, which he gladly slaughters for having the audacity of being found by him.
 Looking this over, I decide I like this character and it fits the setting. I write down a few notes and name him "Aris".

## Step 0.5: Find Out What Rules are in Effect in your Game

 Before you even start filling out your character sheet, you should ask your gaming group if any special rules apply to character creation. Some groups for example might not use SAN, others may give more racial options than just human. The most important thing is for you to find how many starting perks your character has, and what the perk interval is. This is very important to know, and will be explained further down.

 Example: Asking my group, I find that there are 5 starting perks and the perk interval is two weeks. In addition I learn that SAN plays a very important role, and that there are several custom perks. I note this down for later, and consider already what forms of insanity would fit to my character (I pick Stress Disorder).

## Step 1: Primary Attributes

 Primary attributes are the "base" of your character. They allow you to have your character fit into an archetype. Every point in a primary attribute is very valuable, and, after your initial assignment, will rarely change.
 There are for primary attributes:

 * Strength (Str) determines your raw physical mass and muscle power. Characters with higher strength are heavier than other characters of the same height, and can lift more weight, absorb more hits before going down and deal more damage.
 * Dexterity (Dex) determines your nimbleness, fine motor ability and speed. Characters with a high dexterity can easier dodge attacks, can run faster and are better at tasks that require delicate precision.
 * Intelligence (Int) determines your analytic ability, memory and willpower. Characters with a high intelligence are more perceptive, more capable at tasks requiring thinking and are better at resisting things by force of will.
 * Vitality (Vit) determines your health, stamina and "grit". Characters with a high vitality can endure strenuous tasks for longer periods of time, can resist poisons and diseases more easily and are harder to kill.

 Before looking into the numbers, take a moment to consider what primary attributes fit the character you came up with in step 0. In what is he deficient? What tasks is he especially capable of? A warrior would probably have high Str, an archer might have high Dex, a scientist would benefit from high Int and a wizard would benefit from both Vit and Int, since Vit allows him to exert himself more when casting spells.
 A score of 10 is normal in every regard, and not noteworthy. A score of 11 is a slight edge, but not enough to be very noticeable in normal life. 12 is a noticeable talent in a given area. 13 is an unusually high level of talent in a given attribute. 14 or higher is a stunning gift in that attribute. 9 is a minor inconvenience, but not very noticeable. An 8 in an attribute is very noticeable in every day life. A 7 or lower qualifies as a handicap or other impairment. Most humans have 9, 10 or 11 on all attributes. Adventurers and other high power people tend to have a 12 or 13, and truly exceptional individuals have a 14 or even higher in their most important ability.
 Every character begins with a score of 10 in every primary attribute, and must then select a temple from among the following:

 * +1 to one attribute, no penalties
 * +2 to one attribute, and -1 to another
 * +1 to two attributes, and -1 to another
 * +2 to one attribute, +1 to another, -2 to a third and -1 to the last
 * +3 to one attribute, -2 to two others

 Higher bonuses to a single attribute tend to carry higher penalties. This is because a very high attribute is rarer than a few decently high ones.
 Once you have selected your scores, it is important for you to know how to use them. Your score minus 10 is your "attribute modifier", and is what determines how your rolls are affected by that attribute. For example, if I have 12 Str, I have a "+2 Str modifier", and whenever I roll a die regarding strength, I will add that +2. Attribute modifiers CAN be negative! A 9 on Vit would mean I have a "-1 Vit modifier".

 Example: Aris is quick, both with his body and his mind. I select the fourth template, and decide on giving him 8 Str, 12 Dex, 11 Int and 9 Vit. He is definitely more capable of dishing out hits than taking them. This also means he has a -2 Str modifier, +2 Dex modifier, +1 Int modifier and -1 Vit modifier.

## Step 2: Secondary Attributes

 Beyond the primary attributes, there are 10 "secondary attributes". These attributes are a "refinement" of the primary attributes, and are based on them. Unlike primary attributes however, secondary attributes will almost definitely change throughout your character's life. They can be increased over time and are often affected by magical equipment or similar.
 The 10 secondary attributes are:

 * Hit Points, or HP, measure how much injury you can tolerate before going down. As you endure injuries, your current hit point total wanes, and recovers again as you rest or are healed. All kinds of attacks, but also some of your own abilities, can reduce your current HP. Your maximum HP begins equal to your Str score. For example, if you had 10 Str, you would have an HP maximum of 10. Your current hit points can fall to 0 or even below, but if it does, you are in danger of being severely injured or even dying!

 * Fatigue Points, or FP, represent your body's "energy supply". You burn FP gradually from performing strenuous activity, such as forced marching, missing sleep and starvation. You can also deliberately "spend" FP to power abilities such as spellcasting. Your FP recover with rest, similar to HP (but faster). Your FP maximum starts equal to your Vit score. So if you have a Vit of 11, you'd start with 11 FP. If you lose too many FP, you risk falling unconscious or even dying from overexertion!

 * Sanity, or SAN, shows how good of a grip your character still has on reality. As he is exposed to traumatic events, poisons or magic, his current SAN decreases, and eventually he begins to go insane. Your maximum SAN starts at 100 + your Will bonus (which starts as your Int modifier, see below) * 10. So a character starting with 11 Int, and therefor +1 Will, would begin with 110 SAN, a character with 8 Int and -2 Will would start with 80. You can't start with less than 80 SAN. Unlike HP and FP, SAN is very difficult to recover, so be cautious.

 * Attack Bonus is actually two separate attributes: Melee Attack Bonus (MAB) and Ranged Attack Bonus (RAB). MAB determines your ability to hit a foe in combat with a melee weapon, whether a sword, spear or claw. MAB begins as equal to your Str modifier. So if you had 12 Str, you would have +2 MAB. RAB is your skill at hitting foes in combat using a ranged weapon, such as a bow, slingshot or spell. It starts equal to your Dex modifier. So if you had 9 Dex, you would start with a RAB of -1.

 * Armor Class, or AC, is how hard it is to hit you in combat. An enemy has to roll above this number to hit you in combat. Your AC starts as 10 + your Re (rounded up). This will most likely be modified by armor and similar down the line.

 * Will is your ability to resist psychological stress(fear, brainwashing, interrogation, seduction and other tortures etc), to stay concentrated despite distractions and your resistance to many hostile supernatural effects. Your will starts equal to your Int modifier.

 * Reaction, or Re, shows your reflexes and general physical quickness. It determines your running speed, increases your AC by dodging and increases your order in which you act in combat (High Re will let you "out react" foes more easily). To calculate Re, add your Dex modifier and Vit modifier together and divide the whole by two. Do not drop fractions, 1.5 Re is better than 1! This number rounded up is added to all your initiative rolls and to your AC, as long as your encumbrance is not too high (We will come back to this later) and is also added to any rolls to dodge environmental dangers or magic. 

 * Fortitude, or Fort, represents your body's ability to resist damage that isn't directly injury related. This includes poisons, diseases, falling unconscious and some types of magic. Your Fort starts equal to your Vit modifier.

 * Perception, or Per, sets your skill in perceiving things that may not be immediately obvious. During an adventure, when the GM determines that there is something nearby that may be noticed by an alert character, he may call for a Per roll to notice it. Per covers all senses, and includes for example searching a scene for clues. Per is equal to your Int modifier by default.

 * Move, or Mo, is how fast you can run on an unobstructed surface in meters per action, when unencumbered. A human's default move is 4 + double your Re. Your starting Mo cannot be below 3, and a regular human can never have more than 30 Mo. A high Mo will allow you to move around a battle field more effectively...and evacuate it more effectively, too!

 * Basic Lift, or BL, is the weight you can pick up in one hand in one action in kg. It is calculated as Str*Str/10. So Str 10 could lift about (10x10/10) 10 kg, 14 would be about double as strong (14x14/10=19.6), Str 17 is roughly three times as strong (17x17/4=28.9) and 20 Str roughly four times as strong (20x20/10=40). Similarly, Str 7 is about half as strong (7x7/10=4.9), Str 6 about a third as strong (6x6/10=3.6) and Str 5 is only 1/4 as strong (5x5/10=2.5). BL also determines your effectiveness at physical labor such as mining and is important for determining your encumbrance.

 Get a feeling for what the secondary attributes are and think about which ones you might want to increase in the future to fit your character concept. If after this you feel your choice of primary attributes wasn't perfect, go back and change that, you still can now.

 Example: Aris has 8 Str, 12 Dex, 11 Int and 9 Vit. This means he has 8 HP, 9 FP, -2 MAB, +2 RAB, 11 AC, +1 Will, +1 Per, 0.5 Re, 5 Mo and 6.4 BL. Easy enough, right? I note these down and consider that increasing his MAB, Per and Re should be high priorities.

## Step 3: Perks

 Determining your base character has been easy, now comes the hard part. While you now have the most important stats down and a rough character sketched, we now have to actually fine tune our character with the abilities he needs. This is accomplished through a system known as "Perks".
 A perk is the equivalent of 1 month of "growth", whether physical training, studying or just job experience. Every month, you may select one perk for which you fulfill the prerequisites (as listed in the perk description), and immediately gain it's listed benefits. Though this is not universal. Since this progression of one perk per month can mean a very very slow character progression, many gaming groups set the time interval between perks lower (rarely higher). This is the perk interval you were supposed to ask about in step 0.5. Every time this interval elapses, your character earns another perk. Usually, if you join a game late, your character is still awarded the same amount of perks other characters have, but it may not always be so, be sure to ask. Characters also begin with a number of starting perks at beginning of the game, as determined by the campaign you are playing. Most groups forbid changing perks after they are taking, but sometimes you can switch out the last perk your character has acquired.
 Record your perks in chronological order, this is VERY IMPORTANT! Certain perks need a "cooldown" period between times you can take them. Unless otherwise stated, you cannot take a perk more than once, their effects stack and you must always fulfill ALL prerequisites listed BEFORE selecting a perk. Temporary increases, such as from magic items, do NOT count towards fulfilling prerequisites!
 A perk is denoted as follows:

 - Perk Name [Sometimes, a category is listed here, which may effect how the perk is selected] -
 Prerequisites: You must fulfill all criteria listed here before you may take this perk. If you lose a prerequisite after taking a perk, you lose it's benefits until you qualify again. You do NOT gain a perk in exchange for one you no longer qualify for! If no prerequisites are listed, anyone may take the perk.
 Benefit: This is what you gain from having this perk.
 Special: If any special rules apply, such as being able to take this perk multiply times, it will be explained here.

 The perks are listed and explained in the perk document, here [PERK DOCUMENT].

 Note the name of your perk down as you pick it. Take a lot of time considering what perks you wish to take, and in what order. This will probably be what determines your character's abilities to most. Read all perk descriptions carefully, if asked, it is your responsibility to explain what a perk your character has does! If you are unsure of what perks to pick at this time, most game groups allow new players to start with fewer perks, and add them over time as they become more comfortable with the game. Some groups also have custom perk rules, such as free Quirks.

 Example: Aris is joining a two week old Neverwhere game, with a perk interval of 2 weeks and 5 starting perks. If this game had already been running for 4 weeks, he would start with 7 instead of 6 perks. Looking through the perks, I definitely see that I have far too little perks to make the exact character I wanted. Oh well, I guess he's just trying to get better. For my first perk, I will select "Arcane Gift". This gives me the ability to cast spells, but deals 20 permanent sanity damage, reducing my max SAN to 90. For my second perk, I will take Weapon Proficiency (Light Blades), since Aris will primarily fight with light swords and rapiers. As a third, I take Improved Melee Attack, increasing my MAB to -1. I can't take Improved Melee Attack a second time as my fourth perk, since it is a tiered perk and the cooldown isn't over (See the perk doc for an explanation of tiered perks). Instead, I take Spellcasting. To see what that does, see the spellcasting doc [SPELLCASTING]. As my fifth and final perk, I select Improved Melee Attack, increasing my MAB to +0. I now can't select Improved Melee Attack again until I have gained two more perks (effectively making it the third perk from now at the earliest). Finally, I select Survival as my sixth perk, since Aris is a tracker of no small ability. I note all of this down in chronological order.

## Step 3.5: Skills

 You have already been briefly introduced to skills if you read the perk document. Skills are tasks that require time and practice to master, such as acrobatics, herbalism or smithing. Skills are gained, like anything else, as perks. Every time you select a skill perk, you gain a bonus to that skill. The first two perks give +2 each, every further gives +1. Note that all skill perks are tiered, so you reaching high skill levels takes time! 
 A skill is based on one of the four primary attributes, almost always Dex or Int, and has a "difficulty". A skill's difficulty can be easy, medium, hard or very hard. To determine your "default skill" in a skill, take your relevant primary attribute modifier, and apply a penalty of -2 if the skill is easy, -4 if it is medium, -6 if it is hard or -8 if it is very hard. If you ever need to roll against a skill you do not have, use this default skill level. Some skills though are marked "trained only". You cannot attempt to roll against such a skill AT ALL unless you have the skill perk at least once, you automatically fail any roll. Adding your bonus from perks to your default skill level equals your skill level, only note down skills you have perks in, since you can determine the others on the fly if needed.

 Example: Aris has a single skill perk: Survival. Survival is an Int/Easy skill. His Int modifier is +1, and easy means a -2, so his default skill is -1. Taking the perk once makes his survival skill now +1. If I were to take it again, it would be +3. If I would take it a third time, his bonus would be +4, since only the first two perks give +2. I note this down.

## Step 4: Calculate Final Scores and Fill out your Sheet

 Now that you have selected your perks, check them again to see if you are happy with them. First, record the final scores of your primary and secondary attributes. Then, record all your perks in chronological order, and calculate your skill levels. If you begin with items that you will carry at almost all times, you can add their bonuses and calculate your encumbrance here. See the equipment guide for more [EQUIP]. Your character sheet will be most important during adventures, so it may be wise to record it in the state you would be in when beginning an adventure. You can also have multiple sheets of course, detailing different common "loadouts".
 As a simple template, you can use the following (The secondary attributes are ordered by "point-based scores", "combat scores", "resistance scores" and "other scores"):

 Name, Gender Race
 X Str X Dex X Int X Vit
 X HP X FP X SAN
 X MAB X RAB X AC
 X Will X Re X Fort
 X Per X Mo X BL
 Perks: [Collar (Bonus perks), Chronological List of Perks]
 Skills: [List of skills with modifiers]
 Spells: [List of spells, if appropriate]

 Example: Finishing our character, here is his final sheet:

 Aris, Male Human
 8 Str 12 Dex 11 Int 9 Vit
 8/8 HP 9/9 FP 90/90 SAN
 +0 MAB +2 RAB 11 AC
 +1 Will +0.5 Re -1 Fort
 +1 Per 5 Mo 6.4 BL
 Perks: Arcane Gift, Weapon Proficiency (Light Blades), Improved Melee Attack I, Spellcasting, Improved Melee Attack II, Survival I
 Skills: Survival +1
 Spells: Spark-10

## Step 5: Familiarize Yourself with the Rules you Need

 It's a wild world out there, who knows what kinds of dangers and wonders you will meet? You usually will never have to learn EVERY rule there is (though you are most certainly invited to do so), but there are probably many that you will need to play your game of Neverwhere. To make things nice and modular, rules are written in form of little booklets concerning a particular topic. If you want to participate in a certain type of activity, be sure to familiarize with the appropriate rule set! If your character has an ability such as spellcasting, it is YOUR duty to be able to use his abilities without having to ask for clarification, so make sure you understand an ability before taking it!
 Depending on your group, different sets of rules may be more important than others (some may not even be in effect at all), so ask around for recommended reading. In general, it is advisable to read the Rolling Guide, Perks, Skills, Sanity, Combat, Work And Trade, Equipment, and Spellcasting guides, roughly in that order, at the very least. Reading extra rules though almost always rewards you with greater insight into the game, and more enjoyment as a result.

## Step 6: Set Up your Bot Data

 An unusual but important part of Neverwhere is it's bot, a computer program that helps you keep track and calculate things necessary for the game. While your character sheet is a good start, many groups will require you to now also enter all information about your character into the bot, and familiarize yourself with it's usage.
 To do so, read the Bot Tutorial here [TUTORIAL].

## Step 7: Have fun!

 Now you're all set to dive into the exciting world of Neverwhere with your friends. I hope you enjoy this system as much as I did making it, and if you have feedback, comments, ideas or anything else on Neverwhere, direct them to me, YFGM! Feedback helps me make this system better, and I enjoy it, I don't bite I promise!

 Have fun, enjoy the ride!
