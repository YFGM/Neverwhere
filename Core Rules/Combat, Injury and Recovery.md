# It's not "Murderhobo" it's "ADVENTURER", if you please! Combat, Injury and Recovery


  Fighting monsters, outsmarting villains and just all in all getting into trouble is a big part of what makes PnP fun, the combat heavy focus of modern PnPs only confirms that. Combat is, by it's very nature, highly competitive. It's not like anyone ever wants to lose a fight. So to make it fair, fun, and rewarding, it tends to have the most rigorously controlled rule set within a PnP system. But it's not too bad, don't worry! Neverwhere combat is based on a stripped down version of the Pathfinder flavor of d20 OGL combat, one of the most widely used and popular combat systems. This is purposefully held somewhat simple, the most complex concept here is attacks of opportunity that need 4 sentences to explain. This isn't 100% realistic, and it doesn't attempt to be, but should be more than enough to solve most normal combat situation. In addition, you will find the rules necessary for injury and recovery from said injury.
  
 For some more specific and exotic combat situations, see the Advanced Combat Guide.


## How Combat Works 

 "Combat" is defined as any situation in which the order that things happen in is absolutely crucial and time is of the essence. In theory, "combat" doesn't even have to include fighting or death, it could also be a nonlethal competition or a particularly dicey race to get the last slice of apple pie. Combat is a cyclical system, going through the same basic steps every time.


 1. When combat begins, everyone rolls initiative to determine the order in which they act.

 2. If a group was surprised, their enemies get a free "surprise round" in which only they may act.

 3. After the surprise round (if any), the first normal round of combat begins.

 4. Combatants act in initiative order (highest to lowest).

 5. Once everyone has had their turn, the next round begins with the combatant with the highest initiative. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until combat ends.


### The Combat Round

 A "round" represents 6 seconds of time in the game world, there are 10 rounds in one minute. Within a round, every character has a "turn", on which they act. Turns happen in order of the initiatives, from highest to lowest. Each round begins with the turn of the character with the highest initiative, and then proceeds sequentially with the turns of the other characters in descending initiative order. When a character's turn comes up, he performs his entire rounds worth of actions (There are some exceptions to this rule, as explained later).
 
 When the rules refer to a "full round", they usually mean a span of time from a particular initiative count in one round to the same initiative count in the next round. Effects that last a certain number of rounds end just before the same initiative count that they began on.


### Initiative

 At the start of a battle, each combatant makes an initiative check. This is a d20 + your Re + any other bonuses you might have. The GM should definitely note this down for each character. A nat 20 always beats any other roll, and a nat 1 is always worse than any other roll. The characters then act from highest initiative to lowest, and act in the same order every following round (unless a character does something that changes his initiative). Not taking an action in a round still preserves your order in the initiative, but you won't get a second turn next round!
 
 If two or more combatants tie initiative, either the one with the higher Re goes first, or they flip a coin (roll 1d2) to determine who goes first.


### Surprise -

 If combat starts and one party was wholly unaware of another, they are considered "surprised". A group of bandits opening fire on wandering adventurers from the bushes would get a surprise round, but if the adventurers had heard them before (with a successful Per check) and were waiting for them, the bandits would not! Similarly, a group of adventurers that thinks something is in a suspicious bush and are pointing their weapons towards it will deny whatever is in that bush a surprise round...unless it was behind them after all! 
 
 A surprise round functions just like a normal round, except that the surprised characters cannot act and are considered flat footed (see [STATUS EFFECTS]). Next round, the surprised party can act again normally.


## Anatomy of a Turn

 A turn in combat is one character's actions. Every character gets one turn per round (except maybe if he uses some very powerful abilities). There are six types of actions of different duration: Full Round Action (5.5 sec), Standard Action (3.5sec), Move Action (2 sec), Swift Action (0.5 sec), Free Action (0 sec) and Immediate Action (0 sec).
 
 Within a normal turn, you will perform one standard action, one move action, sometimes one swift action and sometimes a free amount of free actions. An immediate action is an action you can take inside or outside of your turn, but only one per round. A full round action is the combination of a standard and a move action into one. You can always forgo one or more of your actions. With each action, you can do different things:


### Standard Action

 The most important of action, a standard action encompasses most "normal" actions such as attacking an enemy or casting a spell. You get one standard action per turn. You can "trade" a standard action for a second move action, but not vice versa!

### Move Action

 The second most important of actions. A move action allows you to move up to your Mo in meters, or perform another action that takes similar time. You can sacrifice your standard action in a turn to perform two move actions, but not vice versa!

### Full Round Action

 Some abilities take longer than others, needing an entire turn of effort to perform. A full round action is using both your standard and move action for one task. You get no standard or move action in a turn in which you perform a full round action. You still get normal swift, free and immediate actions, though.

### Swift Action

 A swift action is a very fast action that takes almost no time, but still enough effort that you can't do it more than once per round. You get one swift action per round, no matter what other actions you took. The most common use of a swift action is to take a 1m step, allowing you to maneuver a bit even if you took a full round action.

### Free Action 

 A free action takes very little time and effort, such as talking tactics with a teammate or shouting insults at an enemy. You may take as many free actions in a turn as you like, as long as the GM finds it reasonable.

### Immediate Action 

 Some actions are so quick, you can even do them when it ISN'T your turn. You can take an immediate action at any time during a round, even in the middle of an enemy's action, but you can't take more than one per round. Many immediate actions cost at least 1 FP and the most common immediate action is an Attack of Opportunity.


## Standard Actions 

 A standard action is the largest chunk of a turn, about 3.5 sec. The most common types of standard actions are:


### Attack -

 Striking an enemy with a weapon or unarmed is a standard action.

 A MELEE ATTACK is a single attack against an enemy that is within your reach (usually 1m) using a weapon. You roll 1d20 + your MAB + any other modifiers you may have against your foe's AC. If you roll above his AC, you hit and roll the damage you deal as appropriate for the weapon you are using, deducting that from your enemy's HP. There are many things that influence attacks, be sure to read how your weapon and abilities might influence this.  
 A natural 20 is a "critical hit", which always hits (as long as the enemy's AC is below your effective attack skill+25) and doubles the damage you deal, but not magical bonuses you may have. A natural 1 is a blunder, you provoke an attack of opportunity from anyone threatening you (See Immediate Actions).

 A MELEE TOUCH ATTACK is an attack that only needs to touch an enemy, but not necessarily pierce their defense. Many spells fall into this category. This functions like a normal melee attack, but the enemy loses all bonuses to AC other than the base 10 and his dodge, size, cover and deflection (magical) bonuses to AC.

 An UNARMED ATTACK is an attack without an object suitable as a weapon, and functions just like a melee attack except as noted here. This includes unarmed punches and using improvised weapons such as chairs, this makes you "unarmed". An unarmed character does not get attacks of opportunity (See Immediate Action) against foes, and provokes one from his target if he attacks and the target is armed. Note that a trained martial artist is considered "armed" even when not wielding a weapon, see the appropriate perks. A successful unarmed strike deals 1d3 + your Str modifier damage, or more if you are using a very large or effective improvised weapon. 

 A RANGED ATTACK is an attack with a weapon that shoots a projectile rather than directly striking the enemy or that is thrown. Roll 1d20 + your RAB + whatever other bonuses apply against the enemy's AC. If you roll above, you hit, and deal damage appropriate to the weapon and projectile used. Unlike a melee weapon, a ranged weapon has a "range increment", depending on the weapon. For every range increment the enemy is away, you take -1 to hit, and you cannot shoot at enemies more than 10 times the range increment (the weapon's "range") for a projectile, or 5 times for a thrown weapon, away unless the weapon allows it specifically. Using a ranged weapon while in melee reach of an enemy provokes an attack of opportunity, so be careful! You can throw a melee weapon as a ranged weapon with a range increment of 3m, and a -4 to hit.  
 A natural 20 is a "critical hit", which always hits (as long as the enemy's AC is below your effective attack skill+25) and doubles the damage you deal, but not magical bonuses you may have. A critical hit does not allow you to exceed a weapon's range. On a natural 1, your attack instead goes for a random ally. Reroll attack, but against your ally's AC! If no ally could reasonably be hit, the attack just goes flying into nowhere.

  A NATURAL ATTACK is an attack using a part of your body, such as claws, bites or stings. Humans by default do not have any natural attacks. A natural attack functions just like a melee attack, except you are always proficient in your natural weapons and cannot be disarmed. You can make multiple attacks as part of a full attack if you have multiple natural attacks, or can use natural attacks and normal weapons. For example, a Ghoul could both bite and swing with a sword, but not use two claws and a sword, and only as a full round action. See full round actions for how full attacks work.

 A DEFENSIVE ATTACK works just like a normal melee attack, but you take -4 to hit. In return, you gain +2 dodge bonus to AC until the beginning of your next turn.


### Total Defense

 You can put everything into defense as a standard action. This gives you a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round. Your AC improves at the start of this action. You can't make attacks of opportunity while using total defense.


### Activate an Item 

 Activating an (usually magical) item is usually a standard action.  
 Using a spell completion item such as a scroll provokes an attack of opportunity. Using a potion does not provoke an attack of opportunity if you have a free hand, but otherwise does. You can also give an ally a potion as a standard action, which does not provoke an attack of opportunity. They then must take a move action to drink it. Wands, rods, staves and other such items do not provoke attacks of opportunity when used.


### Cast a Spell

 Some spells, especially if learned well, take a standard action to cast. See the magic guide on how they function ([MAGIC DOC]). Casting a spell as a standard action provokes an attack of opportunity.


### Start/Complete a Full Round Action

 You can "start a full round action" to start undertaking an action that would normally take a full round action. You complete this action by taking another standard action next round to do so, at which point you perform the action desired. This can be useful if you already used your move action this round or want to stay mobile this and next round while performing the action. You can't use this action to start or complete a full attack, charge, run or withdraw.


### Use a Special Ability

 Many special maneuvers, perks and supernatural abilities take a standard action to use. See their individual descriptions for how they work.


### Perform a Move Action

 You can sacrifice your standard action to perform a move action of any kind. See below for more info on move actions.


## Move Actions

 A move action is shorter than a standard action, about 2.0 sec, and as the name may infer is usually used to move around the battlefield, but other quick abilities may also take a move action. You may take two move actions within one round by sacrificing your standard action.


### Move

 The simplest use of a move action, you can use it to move up to your Mo in meters. This provokes an attack of opportunity. This action also includes non standard modes of movement, such as climbing, flying, jumping, or swimming, which follow slightly different rules. See the appropriate skill descriptions ([SKILL DOC]). You may also crawl 1m as a move action, which provokes an attack of opportunity as well. A crawling character is considered prone and must take a move action to stand up, provoking an attack of opportunity. You can't take a 1m step in the same turn you moved.


### Direct or Cast a Spell

 Many spells take a move action to be manipulated, some can even be cast as a move action. See the spell guide on how this is handled ([SPELL DOC]).


### Draw or Sheathe a Weapon

 Drawing a weapon so that it can be used in combat, or putting it away so you have a free hand, requires a move action. This also applies to any other object that can easily fit in one hand, such as a wand or potions. If your weapon or object is stored in a pack or otherwise out of immediate reach, this action provokes an attack of opportunity. It does not provoke an attack of opportunity if the item is hanging from your belt, is in a sheathe, or otherwise easily accessible. Drawing ammunition for use with a range attack (arrows, bolts etc) is a free action.


### Manipulate an Item

 Moving or manipulating an item is usually a move action. Simple actions such as storing an item in hand, picking up an item or opening a door do not provoke an attack of opportunity. Pushing a heavy object, cleaning the blood off your sword or other more complex actions do provoke an attack of opportunity.


### Mount/Dismount a Steed

 Getting on or off a mount requires a move action. Some unusually large or awkwardly shaped animals may take longer to mount.


### Ready or Drop a Shield

 Readying a shield by strapping it to your arm to gain it's AC bonus or unstrapping and dropping the shield is a move action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. Storing a dropped shield takes a Manipulate an Item move action that does provoke an attack of opportunity.


### Stand Up

 Standing up from a prone position requires a move action and provokes an attack of opportunity.


## Full Round Actions

 A full round action takes an entire round to complete, this means it can't be coupled with a standard or move action, but you still get the normal amount of swift, free and immediate actions.


### Full Attack

 If you have more than one attacks, such as because you are very proficient at fighting, are wielding two weapons or similar, you must make a full attack to utilize those additional attacks. As part of a full attack, you make as many attacks as you have the ability to, at the bonuses appropriate to them. You need not determine ahead of time who all the attacks will target, but can assign the target once the previous attack is resolved. You always attack from your best attack (highest attack bonus) to lowest. After the first attack, you may decide to abort the attack and take a move action instead, for example if the first strike downed your foe.  
 Using two weapons gives you an additional attack, but you need two hands to do so. When using two weapons, you take a -4 to hit with the main weapon, and a -8 to hit with the other (-6 if the off hand weapon is light). You cannot use a two handed weapon while dual wielding. Perks can decrease these penalties.  
 You can also fight defensively as part of a full attack, taking -4 to all attack rolls and gaining a +2 dodge bonus to AC until the beginning of your next turn.


### All Out Attack

 If you're desperate, you can launch everything you've got on an enemy, leaving yourself open. This functions as a Full Attack, but can only be done in melee. You gain one additional attack with your primary weapon, but all attacks you make this round (including attacks of opportunity) have a -4 to hit. You also take a -2 dodge penalty to AC until your next turn, and provoke an attack of opportunity from the foe you are attacking. This costs you 1 FP.


### Cast a Spell

 Some spells, especially just learned, take a full round action or even multiple to cast. Such a spell comes into effect at the end of your last turn of your concentration, meaning it has already endured 1 round by the time your next action dawns. You provoke attacks of opportunity for every round you are casting, and cannot make attack of opportunity yourself.


### Move 1m Through Difficult Terrain

 In some situations, you may need a full round action to move even 1m. While this looks like a 1m step, it is not, and provokes attacks of opportunity normally.


### Run

 As a full round action, you can sprint in a straight line. If you do this, you can't take a 1m step this round. You move up to four times your Mo in a straight line as a sprint. Alternatively, you may do a "paced run", which is 3 times your Mo. After every round of sprinting or every minute of paced running, roll a SN 10 Vit check, on a failure you lose 1 FP. Once you are reduced to 1/3 FP, your movement speed is halved, as described under Fatigue (below).

### Deliver a Coup De Grace

 The "blow of mercy", you may as a full round action deliver a killing blow to a helpless creature. A coup de grace is an automatic critical hit and the target must roll Vit against SN=The damage dealt or die immediately (Drop to -5xHP). Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity.

### Use a Special Ability

 Some special abilities require a full round action or more, read their descriptions for more information.


### Withdraw

 As a full round action, you can "withdraw", moving away from enemies and covering your retreat. You may move up to twice your Mo. You do not provoke an attack of opportunity from any enemies threatening you at the beginning of your withdrawal, but do provoke attacks of opportunity if you run into another enemy's threatened area. You can't take a 1m step in the same round that you withdraw.  
 As an exception to normal rules, if you are due to a status effect restricted to only one standard action per round, you may withdraw as a standard action. Note that despite the name of this action, you don't have to leave combat entirely.


## Free Actions

 Free actions take no time at all, and in theory you can take as many free actions within a turn as you wish, as long as it is reasonable (GM is the final judge).


### Cease Concentration on a Spell

 You can stop concentrating on a spell (or something else) as a free action.


### Drop an Item

 Dropping an item next to you or somewhere within reach is a free action.


### Drop Prone

 Dropping to a prone position is a free action.

### Speak

 In general, speaking is a free action that you can perform even when it isn't your turn. Speaking more than a few sentences per round is probably unrealistic, and a GM can if he wishes limit the communication between players IC if they speak whole novels in between actions.


## Swift Actions

 A swift action similarly to a free action consumes very little time but has a somewhat higher expenditure of effort. You can perform one swift action per turn, no matter what other actions you took. The most common swift actions are taking a 1m step and activating certain spells or items. 

### Take a 1m Step

 As a swift action, you can move 1m without provoking an attack of opportunity. You cannot move in the same round you take a 1m step, neither before nor after your step. You can also not take a 1m step if your movement is hampered by difficult terrain or darkness or if your Mo is 1 or less.


### Cast a Quickened Spell

 A spell affected by the "Quicken" meta spell can be cast as a swift action, as can any spell whose listed casting time is a swift action.


## Immediate Actions

 An immediate action is similar to a swift action, but you can perform it even if it isn't your turn! You can only take one immediate action per round. The most common use of an immediate action is to perform an attack of opportunity, and most other uses need strong abilities and often cost FP. Flat Footed characters may not take immediate actions.


### Attack of Opportunity -

 Sometimes a combatant may let their guard down or perform a reckless action, leaving them open to attack. In this case, their enemies can capitalize on the situation and perform a quick attack, called an Attack of Opportunity.
 
 A character is said to "provoke" an attack of opportunity whenever he performs certain actions that let his guard down. Actions that do so are marked as such, and this includes moving and casting spells. Provoking an attack does nothing though if there is no one around to take advantage of it. Any character within an armed (see unarmed attacks under standard actions) enemy's melee reach (for humans, this is 1m) is considered "threatened". When a threatened character provokes an attack of opportunity, any enemy currently threatening them may spend an immediate action to take that attack of opportunity.
 
 An attack of opportunity is a normal melee attack for all purposes except that it happens BEFORE the one struck can perform his action and doesn't cost the attacker a standard or full round action. Resolve attack and damage normally, and note this might disrupt what the other was trying to do! If an attack of opportunity renders the action the character was attempting impossible (because, for example, he was reduced to a disabled state) he loses that action.


## Special Initiative Actions

 There are two ways in which you can modify in what order you act in combat. You can delay your turn or ready an action.

### Delay

 By choosing to delay, you take no actions and then act on whatever initiative counter you desire. When you delay, you voluntarily reduce your initiative count for the rest of combat. When your new, lower initiative count comes up in the turn order, you can act normally. You can reduce your initiative result to a specific value or just wait until some time later in the round and act then, fixing your initiative count on that point. You never get back the time you spend waiting to see what's going to happen. You also CAN'T interrupt someone else's actions. If your next turn dawns and you haven't taken any action, you don't get the delayed actions.
 
 If you take your delayed action in the next round before your turn comes up, your initiative count RISES to the new point in the order of battle, but you do not get a regular action that round.

### Ready

 You can prepare an action for the case of a specific event. As a standard action, you can specify a standard, move, swift or free action and under what circumstances you will take it. For example, you can decide to wait and shoot an arrow once an enemy begins to cast a spell. If before your next turn the situation you specified occurs, you may immediately perform the action you readied just before the situation occurs. If the triggering situation involves another character's action, you interrupt the action and get your readied action. If the situation does not occur or you decided not to act on it and your next turn begins, you lose your readied action, but may ready a new one this round.



### Movement, Position and Distance 

 Since Neverwhere is a simpler system and doesn't by default use battlemaps (you may use them, of course), most of the movement, position of characters and distance from things is up to the GM. His word COUNTS when determining whether a move would provoke an attack of opportunity, an enemy is within range, or similar. A GM though may not only tell a character that a move he makes provokes an attack of opportunity, he is REQUIRED to always warn players before they take the action. Some trust between the GM and Players is required here, but so far it has worked pretty well in PnP so I think there will be no big issues, just have some common courtesy. (Tip to GMs: If in doubt, give the players the more favorable alternative)
 
 If you wish to use a battlemap, aka a top down map of the happening with counters to represent the characters engaging in combat and other features, divide it into squares of 1x1m size. Whenever the rules speak of a "square", they mean 1x1 squares. A typical character occupies 1 such square, and can reach all those around that square. Larger creatures take up multiple squares, and can reach over more squares. You can't move through an occupied square, except by tumbling (See Acrobatics in the Skill Guide [SKILL DOC]). 
 
 One move action gives you your Mo in movement to "spend". Moving from one square to the next "costs" one Mo, except when moving diagonally. When moving diagonally, the first square you move costs one Mo, the second one costs two, the third one one Mo, the fourth one two Mo, and so on. Bad terrain, darkness and other effects can make moving a square more "expensive". See the Environment Guide for examples. If you don't have enough Mo to move into another square, you can't move, but you can ALWAYS move at least 1m per round as a full round action unless immobilized.



## Injury

 Wounds, poisons, disease, magic and many other things cause 'injury': A (usually) temporary loss of Hit Points. Injury often results from 'penetrating damage': the damage left over after any appropriate resistances are subtracted. However, disease, overexertion and the like can cause injury without damage. 
 
 If any injury reduces you to 0 or fewer HP, you will soon fall unconscious. You can even go into -HP, but too far and you risk death. Normally, the difference between full HP and death is about 3-5 sword hits, which is both realistic and dramatic. Even in fantasy, heroes rarely shrug off dozens of blows. Instead, they avoid being hit. Armor helps, but fights can be deadly, so think before you act!(!!!)


### Crash Course in Human Anatomy for PnP
 
  A human (or similar humanoid) has the following body parts for combat purposes: Two hands, two feet, one face, one skull, one torso, two arms, two legs and one pair of eyes. The vitals and groin are sub divisions of the torso.
 One hand is considered the "main hand", the other one the "off hand". The main hand functions as one would expect, the off hand can wield a second weapon, manipulate an item, or similar. Any weapon wielded in the off hand gains only 50% of one's Str mod to it's damage, and has other penalties as described under Full Attack above if wielded together with another weapon. 
 
 This is all we really need to know for the moment.

 
### General Injury: Lost Hit Points

 Repeated wounding eventually causes anyone or anything to weaken and collapse, even if no singly injury is very great. Below are the effects of reaching certain thresholds of lost HP, all effects are cumulative.


* 0 HP or less - You are in immediate danger of collapse. Roll a SN 5 + HP below 0 Will roll once per minute. You must also reroll this every time you take additional damage. Failure means you fall unconscious. Success means you are disabled (see [STAT DOC]). If you do nothing on your turn other than lie still or crawl (1 Mo), you need roll only once every 15 minutes. Once you reach -1 HP, you also begin to bleed for 1 damage per minute until you receive first aid (see [SKILL DOC]).
 
* -1xHP - In addition to all above effects, you need to immediately roll Vit against SN 10+2 per increment of HP below 0 or DIE. If you succeed, you are disabled. Roll again each time you receive a further HP increment of damage, aka -2xHP, -3xHP etc. If you fail a roll to not fall unconscious while at -10 or lower, you instead fall into a coma.
 
* -5xHP - You die immediately. You have lost a total of *6* times your HP, nobody can survive that much injury.
 
* -10xHP - Total bodily destruction, if this makes sense given the source of damage - 200 points of arrow wounds leave a messy but recognizable corpse, 200 points of fire injury leaves nothing but an unrecognizable lump of charcoal. The difference can be important if resurrection, reanimation, etc. is possible.

#### Types of Damage

 Depending on what you are struck with, you may take different "types" of damage. The six mundane types of damage are bludgeoning, burning, corrosion, piercing, slashing and toxic.
 
 Bludgeoning damage is any damage caused by blunt trauma such as a club hit or fall. Burning damage is damage that causes tissue to burn and combust, such as fire or electricity. Corrosion damage is damage that dissolves a target's structure, such as acid or a disintegrate spell. Piercing attacks is damage dealt on a rather small area that burrows deep into a victim, such as an arrow or spear hit. Slashing damage is caused by weapons designed to cut long wounds on enemies, such as axes and swords. Toxic damage is caused by poisons and chemicals disrupting internal organ functions.
 
 There are also several magical types of damage. These are acid, cold, fire, force, lightning and sonic. These are unrelated to mundane types of damage for the most part, except that resistance to burning damage protects from fire and lightning, but not vice versa. Similarly, protection from corrosion protects against magical acid, but not vice versa. Magical sonic attacks ignore object DR if the object is brittle, and force attacks ignore all forms of DR. These damage types are dealt only by magical attacks.
 
 There are rumors of even more powerful damage types such as Epic, Para-Reality and Omega damage, but if such a thing exists it is used by creatures so vastly more powerful than us that we will probably never come into contact with them. We can be sure that such damage would overcome any DR and probably have other devastating effects.

#### Damage Reduction (DR)

 DR stands for "damage reduction" and is a powerful resistance some creatures and characters have. DR is given as "DR X/Y" or "DR X (Y)", where X is a number and Y is a mundane or magical damage type. X/Y DR means that all damage EXCEPT Y is reduced by X. For example, DR 5/bludgeoning would reduce the damage taken by a spear hit by 5, but not from a mace hit. DR X (Y) means that ONLY damage of type Y is reduced by X. DR 5 (Fire) would reduce the damage from a fireball spell by 5, but not of a lightning bolt spell!
 
 DR cannot reduce a damage received below zero, and applies once per attack, meaning that every swing from a character doing a full attack with two weapons has DR applied to it separately.  
 Some DRs such as e.g. DR 5/Cold Iron are not overcome by a certain damage type, but by an attack of a certain nature, such as by a weapon made from Cold Iron. These types of DR are also automatically overcome (ignored) by any form of magical damage (acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, sonic).


### Exhaustion: Losing FP
 
 Running long distances, casting spells, being suffocated and many other things can cause "Fatigue", a temporary loss of Fatigue Points. Your Fatigue Point (FP) maximum starts as equal to your Vit (so 10 by default), but perks and other things can modify this. In the same way HP represents physical damage accumulated, fatigue represents lost energy and exhaustion. When you lose FP, keep track of it the same way as HP. Note that many of these rules are optional, tracking exactly how much you sleep or eat a day can usually be safely ignored, but if such a situation should become relevant (such as when determining if you fall asleep while standing guard on an adventure), here is where to look for guidance!  
 As you lose Fatigue Points, you become continually more and more exhausted. Below are summarized the effects of low or negative FP:
 
* Less than 1/4 of your maximum FP left - You are very tired, this state is also called "exhausted". Your Move, Dodge and Str is HALVED (round up). Str based attributes such as HP are unaffected, but skill checks based on Str are.
 
* 0 FP or less - You are on the verge of collapse. If you suffer further fatigue, every point of lost FP also causes 1 HP of damage due to overexertion. Thus fatigue from starvation, dehydration, etc, will eventually kill you - and you CAN work yourself to death! To do anything but talk or rest, you must roll a Will roll against SN (10+FP below zero) once per 10 minutes out of combat or per round in combat. On a success, you can act normally. You may use FP to cast spells or anything else and if you are drowning you continue to struggle, but you still lose 1 HP per lost FP. On a failure, you collapse, incapacitated, and can do nothing other than light conversation or sleeping until you recover to positive FP. On a critical failure, make an immediate Vit roll against SN (10+negative FP). On a failure, you suffer a heart attack (See Mortal Conditions [STATS DOC])!
 
* 1xFP - You fall unconscious. While unconscious, you recover lost FP at the same rate as for normal rest. You awaken once you reach positive FP. Your FP can never fall below this level. After this stage, any FP cost comes off HP instead!

### Other Types of Damage

 Some unusual abilities can also cause other types of damage to a character. 

#### Attribute Damage

 Especially undead are fond of "attribute damage". This works similar to other damage, but is deducted from the attribute targeted, such as Str. This affects all secondary attributes, attribute rolls and skills and anything else based on that attribute, recalculate those rolls appropriately for the new attribute. If your Str is reduced to 0, other than having a base HP of 0, you are considered disabled and cannot pick up any item at all! A suit of armor renders you immobile! Reducing your Dex to 0 renders you paralyzed. If your Int falls to 0, you suffer a seizure. And finally if your Vit reaches 0, you fall into a coma and WILL die without roll in 24 hours if your Vit does not recover for some reason. All these effects persist until the attribute reaches at least 1. Primary attributes cannot be decreased below 0, secondary attributes cannot be reduced below -10.


#### Flaws and Status Effects -

 Some magical and unusual attacks bestow flaws, status effects or other unusual conditions on enemies. See for [STAT DOC] for some possible status effects. Read the individual effect's description for how long these effects last and how they work exactly.


#### Called Shots and Crippled Limbs

 As part of a normal attack, you can do a "called shot". This means you are targeting a certain part of the enemy's body instead of just whatever you happen to hit. Doing this can allow you to cause additional damage and possibly cripple an enemy's limb you targeted. All out attacks can never target a specific area. Each location gives a penalty to attack (given in parentheses).
 
* Torso (0): The chest and abdomen. No penalty to hit, and no effect on damage. This is the default Hit Location, if you don't specify, it is assumed you attack the torso.
 
* Vitals(-4): The heart or lungs (from the front) or kidneys (from the back). Piercing attacks deal +2 damage when you hit such a location, and if you ever crit such a location with a piercing weapon, the damage is tripled instead of doubled.
 
* Skull(-6): The part of the head that houses the brain. If you hit, you also deal 1d4 FP damage with your attack, but your attack deals 2 less HP damage. If you crit however, your foe is staggered for 1d4 rounds.
 
* Eye(-11): Only piercing weapons can target the eye. If you deal at least one tenth of the enemy's maximum HP in damage, you blind your victim (cripple the eyes). Otherwise treat as a skull hit.
 
* Face(-6): The jaw, cheeks, nose and ears. A hit deals 1d3 FP damage in addition to any other damage. A critical hit is just like a skull hit. A corrosive attack deals 50% more damage and blinds one eye, both if the damage exceeds full HP, making him blind.
 
* Neck(-5): The neck and throat. Slashing attacks deal 1d6 more damage and the GM may rule that any death through a slashing attack to the neck is decapitated. A successful bludgeon attack causes the victim to cough for 1d3 rounds.
 
* Groin(-4): The lower torso. Treat as a normal torso hit, except that males suffer severe pain for 1d4 rounds after a successful strike.
 
* Arm or Leg(-2): Any attack that deals at least 1/2HP in a single blow cripples the limb.
 
* Hand or Feet(-4): As for an arm or leg, but the damage need only be 1/3HP to cripple the body part.


 When using called shots, sufficient injury to a limb, extremity, or eye may cripple it. This requires a **single** injury that exceeds a certain amount of damage. These thresholds are:
 
* Limb (arm, leg, wing): Over 1/2xHP of damage
* Extremity (foot): Over 1/3xHP of damage
* Eye: Over 1/10xHP of damage
 
 It is sometimes possible to cripple a limb with less damage or no damage at all with special abilities. A blow to a limb or extremity can never cause more injury than the minimum required to cripple that limb. For example, if you had 10 HP and were struck for 9 damage to your arm, you would only lose 5 HP, the limb is then thoroughly busted and additional attacks won't harm the person as a whole further. Exception: No such limitation applies to the eyes.

 If injury to a body part before the above limits was at least twice what was needed to cripple it, the body part is not just crippled but DESTROYED! A slashing attack or explosion severs a limb or extremity, which can make reattachment possible, otherwise, it's irrevocably crushed, burned, etc.
 
 Below are additional effects that also occur when a limb is crippled, all effects also apply to dismemberment as well. These last for the fight's duration, and longer as detailed under duration.
 
* Hand: You drop anything you were carrying in that hand. You cannot hold anything in that hand. You can wear a shield on it, but you cannot attack with it. 
 
* Arm: As for a crippled hand, but while someone with a crippled hand could at least carry something in the crook of the arm, you cannot use a crippled arm to carry anything! You do not drop a shield, but cannot use it at all. If an arm or leg is crippled, you are at half Mo. While one arm is crippled, you take -4 to any task that would require the usage of both, and some tasks may be impossible (such as wielding a two handed weapon). 
 
* Foot: If no other foot is crippled, you fall to half Mo. If both of your feet are crippled, you cannot walk and suffer from the Lame (Crippled Legs) Flaw.
 
* Leg: If no other leg is crippled, you fall to half Mo. If both of your legs are crippled, you fall and can only crawl, suffering from the Lame (Missing Legs) Flaw.
 
* Eye: You are blind. Until healed, you are considered blinded.


 If you suffer from a crippling injury, roll a Vit roll against SN 10 to determine how serious it is. For battlefield injuries, roll at the end of combat. Success means the crippling is temporary, failure means it's lasting, and nat 1 means it's permanent! Dismemberment is automatically permanent, no need to roll.
 
* Temporary Crippling: Until you are back at full HP, you suffer the disadvantages described above. Once you are fully healed, the effects disappear.
* Lasting Crippling: You suffered a broken bone, badly torn (or burned) muscle, or other lingering damage. Roll 1d12, this is the number of weeks it will take for the injury to heal! (A good physician or surgeon can lower this time!)
*  Permanent Crippling: You lose the use of that body part. It is either nonfunctional or GONE! You are crippled for life most probably, but there might be ways to cure even this degree of injury.

### Death

 If your character is killed, your stay here in this world is most probably over, unless maybe you are saved by a speedy Physician (see [SKILL DOC]). 
 
#### Instant Death
 Decapitation, being thrown in a volcano etc can kill anyone, regardless of HP (As can some powerful spells such as Finger of Death). If plot reasons dictate a character has no chance of surviving what so ever, don't bother to roll damage, just assume they fell to -5xHP. Note that in combat or a murder attempt, a victim might survive, see coup de grace.
 
#### Dying Actions
 When a PC or important NPC is killed in any but the most sudden and thorough fashion, the GM should allow a "dying action". If this is a final blow to an enemy, it should take no more than a turn. If it's a deathbed speech, the GM should stretch time a little bit for dramatic purposes! This has nothing to do with realism, but it's fun.

#### Death Flag
 You stare down your blade into the eyes of your nemesis. Your heart pumps slowly, calmly, the entire world seemingly slowing down as you raise your weapon, hundreds of innocents in the town beyond you, you the only one between them and the horror before you. Your time has come. It is time to be a hero, or die trying.
 
 Death Flag is an optional rule that can be used with Neverwhere to give PCs some "plot armor". This rule is not in any way realistic, but is intended to save frustration from some random bad luck ending a promising story, which can be excruciatingly frustrating. This rule should only be used globally (aka in all adventures) or not at all, otherwise it becomes unbalancing quickly. Ask your GMs if it is in use in your campaign.
 
 With this rule in effect, PCs that fail a roll to resist death, but have more than -5xHP, do not die, but are "critically injured". Treat as a coma, except each time you would fail a roll to resist death, you instead lose 1d8 HP. If you reach -5xHP, you must roll to resist death once per hour, as normal, and die for real if you fail. If a single attack would reduce you from less than -1xHP to -5xHP or worse, your HP falls to 1 above -5xHP. Further attacks affect your normally. You're unusually lucky in not being killed, but not invincible!
 
 This way, "dying" will still punish the character and player, he will probably be out of commission for quite a while, but does not necessarily end a great story arc just because of a bad die roll.
 
 Sometimes though, it may be appropriate to the story that your character could die. Facing down his archenemy, putting his life on the line to save his loved ones etc. In such a scenario, the player may decide to "raise his death flag". If he does so, all normal rules for dying now apply to his character, but great luck comes to a character that risks everything. He gains a +4 luck bonus to MAB, RAB, AC, spellcasting rolls and to rolls to resist unconsciousness while his death flag is raised. Once his death flag is raised, it remains so until he spends at least 24 hours outside of life threatening situations, at which point it resets to normal. This means that even after your dramatic showdown you might be prone to death, so be careful!
 
 GMs are free to deny a character from raising their death flag if the situation is suitably trivial. You should only raise your death flag in a situation where you would truly die for a good outcome, not to get a combat bonus in a normal fight!
 
 Some special NPCs may also have a death flag, but most do not.


## Recovering from Injury

 Life as an adventurer is often tough, but don't despair! You can get better! ...maybe.

 By default, a character recovers 1 HP per 24 hours no matter what. This can be sped up by first aid, physicians and others (See skills [SKILL DOC]). Healing spells or items can greatly increase the recovery rate, maybe even healing a character to full health from the brink of death in seconds! See the Healing College for more information. Some damage cannot be healed naturally, and needs special attention, as explained by whatever ability caused it.

 You can recover "ordinary" lost FP by resting quietly. Reading, talking and thinking are all fine, walking around or anything more strenuous is not. Lost FP return at the rate of 1 FP per 10 minutes of rest. A particularly restful setting including a comfortable bed, controlled climate and a decent meal allows you to recover an additional FP. Certain drugs, magic potions and spells can restore missing FP, see the individual descriptions for more info. You can only recover from fatigue caused by missed sleep by sleeping for at least one full sleep period. This restores 1 FP. Further uninterrupted sleep restores 1 FP per hour. You need food or water to recover FP lost to starvation or dehydration.

 If you are unconscious (but NOT in a coma!) and have 1 or more HP, you awaken automatically in 5 minutes. If you are at 0HP or worse, but above -10HP, make a SN 10 Vit roll every hour. On a success, you wake up and are disabled, as per the normal injury rules.

 If you fall into a coma, you get a single Vit roll to recover after 12 hours at SN 10. On a success, you become disabled. If you fail, you will not recover without medical assistance. You still recover HP as would be normal for your situation (which might be negative if you are bleeding). Until you receive medical attention (long term care, intensive care, an operation or a healing spell, as described under the First Aid, Physician and Surgery skills), you must roll Vit versus SN 10+2 per increment of HP below 0 every 12 hours. If you fail, you DIE!
