--- Rolling Guide ---

- When to roll, how to roll, what to roll. The art of rolling. Rolling dice that is. Rolling is very important, and you should roll when needed. Try not to roll too much though, otherwise rolling could get boring. And no one like boring rolling, unless that's the way you roll. -

 In the world of PnP gaming, there is hardly an so important aspect of the game as rolling dice. This is critically important to make the game fair and varied. This has been done since the very dawn of PnP gaming, and for very good reasons. It allows you to fairly match the abilities of characters against difficult tasks, and makes it feel worthy when your hard work pays off and you are rewarded. Knowing when to roll and what to roll is an ability every GM should master to make their games run fluidly and fairly. This information is useful both to people new to Neverwhere in particular, and to PnP in general. Even experienced gamers will benefit from learning how rolling works within Neverwhere.


-- Rolling Basics and Terminology --

 Neverwhere is a so called d20-based system, which means it is based mostly on the use of a 20-sided die. This means it has a linear distribution of probability, which is NOT realistic, a Gaussian distribution, such as when using 3d6, would be more realistic since it favors moderate rolls over more extreme rolls. When rolling a 20 sided dice, every possible face has the same chance of being rolled, 5%. This makes it much more likely for very good, but also very bad rolls, to happen, which from your author's experience is usually more fun. 
 In the world of D&D-esque PnP, there is some jargon worth knowing. When someone says "to roll a dX", he means to roll a die (d) with X sides. So calling for a d6 is asking you to roll a 6 sided die. Someone calling "to roll YdX" means to roll Y amount of X sided dice. So saying "roll 3d6" means you should roll 3 six sided dice, and usually add their values together, but not always. "Beating" a roll, also called "succeeding" and similar such terms, is the term for when your roll means that what ever you attempted worked the way you wanted to. A "failure" means your attempt did not work as intended. 
 Neverwhere uses the "beat" system of rolling, which means two things: Higher rolls are better, and you have to be ABOVE whatever you are rolling against to succeed. "Rolling against Z" (sometimes also called a "check") means that you must roll above the number Z for your attempt to succeed. This number Z is also called the "Success Number" or "SN" (Called Difficulty Check or DC in D&D). Rolling equal to the SN is a failure in Neverwhere. There are two special rolls, the "natural 1" (or "nat1" or "critical failure" or "crit fail") and the "natural 20" (or "nat20" or "critical success" or "crit success"), which mean that on a d20 (and only on a d20), the number the die rolled is either a 1 or a 20, respectively. If you roll nat 1, your attempt automatically fails in the worst way possible. If you roll a nat 20, your attempt automatically succeeds in the best way realistically possible. Note that even a nat 20 does not allow you to succeed at IMPOSSIBLE tasks! 
 When rolling a die and attempting a task, almost always there will be "modifiers", also called "bonuses" when positive and "penalties" when negative. These are numbers, either positive or negative, that are added to your die roll to determine your final "roll". Your "roll" tends to include all applicable modifiers, your "natural roll" is what the die actually showed. Modifiers can be applied for your skill, good or bad environmental conditions, and a variety of other reasons, depending on the situation. Generally, unless noted otherwise, when rolling multiple dice with modifiers, you add all your natural rolls together and THEN apply any applicable modifiers to get your final roll. Note that when your modifiers plus natural roll add up to 1 or 20, it is NOT a crit fail or crit success. Such rolls are sometimes called a "unnatural 1" or "unnatural 20".
 By default, the SN is set by what you are ACTING UPON, and the modifiers are set by what is ACTING UPON YOU. In that sense, when rolling, you are the "attacker" and the object you are trying to affect the "defender". Say when picking a lock, you are acting upon a lock, trying to open it. The SN to succeed is therefor set by the lock, if it is a very good or even enchanted lock, the SN increases, but usually NOT the modifiers. If something is acting on you though, such as darkness obscuring your sight, poison numbing your Dexterity, or similar, those things are usually applied as modifiers. Vice versa of course if someone is trying to affect you. Your Armor Class (AC) is basically your SN to be hit in combat, for example.
 Generally, a player rolls for anything applicable to his PC, but sometimes the GM rolls in secret for things that the player should not know about, such as some perception rolls to spot hidden enemies. NPC rolls are done usually by the controlling GM. When you are in doubt about what roll should succeed: The "defender" wins a tie by default, if applicable. Otherwise, the GM's judgement counts as always.
 A "skill" is any kind of proficiency or action in the widest sense of the word, anything from lock picking to sneaking to bomb defusing. "Using" such a skill is synonymous with calling for a roll, and any bonuses you may have to that skill or group of skills applies to your roll. Skills, like everything else, appear in form of perks, or simply default to a standard attribute roll (See [SKILL DOC]).

-- When to Roll --

 To avoid bogging down the game with endless rolls, roll ONLY WHEN YOUR GM TELLS YOU TO. Do NOT roll when not asked. You may ask your GM whether you should roll, but do not roll until he gives you the ok, it is considered highly impolite. The GM should only call for rolls if there is a chance for MEANINGFUL FAILURE or GAINFUL SUCCESS. In particular, a GM should require rolling when:

 * A PC's health, wealth, friends, reputation or equipment are at risk. This includes chases, combat (even if the target is stationary, unaware and at point blank range!), sneaking, spell casting, and similar "adventuring" activity.
 * A PC stands to gain allies, information, new abilities, social standing or wealth.

 The GM should NOT require rolls for:

 * Utterly trivial tasks, such as crossing the street, feeding the dog, finding the inn or putting on your clothes.
 * Daily work at a mundane, nonadventuring job (So cooking a simple dinner for inn guests wouldn't call for a roll, but trying to make a huge cake to impress a royal counts as 'adventuring activity', since a lot is at stake, and should require a roll, as does job related skills that turn a hard coded profit!)

There are two sets of circumstances under which the GM can/should roll for a PC and not allow the player to see the results:

 * When the CHARACTER wouldn't know for sure whether he had succeeded or not. This is true for all rolls to gain information, such as Sense Motive, searching an area and information spells. In this case, the player declares he is using the ability in question, and the GM rolls for success in secret. On a success, the GM gives the player true information, the higher the roll, the better the information. On a failure, the GM gives either no information or lies (the lower the roll, the more severe the lie), as appropriate. This also applies to many other things, if you don't taste test your cake before serving it, you won't be sure how good it tastes either!
 * When the PLAYER shouldn't know what's going on. This includes most sense rolls. Suppose the party is walking through the forest, and up ahead a group of goblins are hiding in the canopy. The GM should not say "There are some Goblins hiding up ahead, everyone roll perception to see if you spot it.", that would ruin the whole surprise! It is acceptable to say things such as "everyone roll perception", with no further info yet, but in normal PnP, the GM usually rolls completely in secret for such rolls. If the PCs succeed, the GM would say something like "You notice a bit further up ahead a group of Goblins hiding in the bushes, ready to attack!", otherwise...well, they're in for a surprise. For this reason, GMs should have their PCs' stats on hand so they don't have to ask when pressed.


-- Modifiers --

 The rules very often specify modifiers for certain rolls. These bonuses and/or penalties affect your final roll. Bonuses improve your odds, and penalties worsen them, obviously. A modifier is given as either "+X" or "-X", denoting a bonus or penalty, respectively.
 For instance, when attempting to pick a lock (a roll based on Dex), you might take -5 for working in complete dark. The SN is set by the quality of the lock, you roll a d20, add your Dex modifier as a bonus and from whatever you roll plus your skill you subtract 5 to find your final roll, if it is above the SN, you succeeded. A nat 1 is an immediate failure and a nat 20 an immediate success, regardless of modifiers (Assuming the SN is at most Skill+25, see Critical Success below). Your skill at a given task, whether attacking or lock picking or farming, is called your "Base Skill". This base skill with all modifiers applied is called your "Effective Skill". Your effective skill of course may vary from one situation to the next. The terms "Base Skill" and "Effective Skill" apply to ALL rolls, skill or not.
 Modifiers are cumulative unless stated otherwise (important since most spells of the same type do not stack). Even if your Effective Skill is above the SN, you must still roll in case there is a nat 1, same for if your Effective Skill is below the SN-20, a nat 20 might still succeed, somewhat at least.


- Default Rolls-

 When you attempt some action, ideally, you should at least have SOME proficiency in it. But even an untrained person can take a stab at most things. ANYONE can swing a sword, but only a trained warrior is likely to have much success with it.
 A skill that anyone can attempt without study is said to "default" to some other skill or attribute. This means you can roll for this skill by rolling with the skill or attribute it defaults to, at a penalty. Having a very very high Str will probably help you wield a greatsword even if you never trained with one before, and in the same way having trained with first aid will probably help you do surgery.
 The description of the appropriate perk or skill will state what skills or attributes it defaults to, and at what penalty.
 Some actions though are IMPOSSIBLE without training, such as casting an unknown spell or attempting to program a Quantum Computer without speaking it's native language. These skills are said to have "no default" or be "trained only", and you can't attempt them at all if you lack some perk for their usage.
 If in doubt whether a given situation calls for a skill roll, and whether it calls for a default (assuming the Neverwhere registry doesn't list the task at hand), is up to the GM.

- Equipment Modifiers -

 The quality of your equipment for your skill rolls is the most basic and common modifier, especially for complex skills:

 * No equipment: -10 for technological skills, -5 for others. Many skills cannot be used at ALL without the appropriate equipment!
 * Improvised Equipment: -5 for technological skills, -2 to others.
 * Basic Equipment: No modifier. This is the case most of the times.
 * Good-quality equipment: +2. Costs about 5x the normal price.
 * Fine-quality equipment: +4. Costs about 20x the normal price.
 * Best equipment possible at your tech level: +5 or better (No upper limit depending on skill and tech level)! This kind of equipment is not usually for sale and is hard to come by.

 If your equipment is not in perfect condition, the following modifiers apply in ADDITION to quality modifiers:

 * Missing important items: -1 per item, especially important items may render the skill not possible to use
 * Damaged equipment: -1 to -6, depending on severity of damage.

 Equipment modifiers reflect the quality of:

 * Special "tools of the trade*, for criminal, military or adventuring skills such as Disguise, Explosives, Forgery, Lockpicking etc.
 * The contents of your backpack, for outdoor skills like Fishing or Survival. 
 * Your instruments or lab for scientific and medical skills, such as Alchemy, Biology, Chemistry or Surgery.
 * Your shop or toolkit for Carpentry, Engineering, Machinist, Masonry, Mechanic, Smith and other skills used to build or repair things.
 * Your studio for artistic skills such as Artistry etc.

 Example: For First Aid, "improvised" might mean leaves and clean mud, "basic" sterile bandages, "good" a standard (relatively modern) first aid kit, "fine" a modern crash kit and "best" an entire hospital. Missing antiseptics might give -1, while a first aid kit salvaged from a dead foe might give -1 or worse due to damage.

- Time Spent and Taking 10 -

 You can gain a bonus at most tasks if you work slowly and deliberately. Conversely, if you are racing against the clock, even the most simple of tasks can become tricky:

 * Extra Time: Taking more time than usual for a task (as specified by the rules or GM) gives a bonus to NONCOMBAT actions: twice as long gives +1, 4x as long gives +2, 8x gives +3, 15x gives +4 and 30x gives +5. For example, taking a work day (eight hours) to do a one hour task would give +3. This bonus only applies if it would make sense to take extra time for the task at hand (GM's discretion). You can take extra time to pick a lock, but not to pursue a fleeing suspect!
 * Haste: Hurrying gives a penalty: -1 per 10% less time taken. For instance, attempting a task in half the usual time (50%) is at -5. The maximum reduction is normal 90%, at -9. Sometimes for the sake of cinematic fun, a GM might allow an INSTANT attempt at -10 (or worse), such as getting a machine to work by kicking it! You cannot take haste on tasks that require a certain amount of time due to natural laws (such as chemical reactions) or the limitations of equipment (speed of a boat for instance). When in doubt, the GM's decision is final.

 Note that some skills such as magic spells have their own rules for extra time that supersede these rules.
 When a character is reasonably proficient in a certain task, such as their day to day job, and they are not pressed for time, they may "take 10". Don't roll any die and assume they rolled a 10, and determine success as appropriate. This is a useful time saving rule for say, a patrol guard's perception check, your attempt at doing any normal daily task etc. You may NEVER take 10 in combat unless you have an ability that specifically allows you to!

- Interlude: Long Tasks -

 As an optional rule, the GM may define major projects as "long tasks" that require a number of man-hours of work with one or more attributes or skills. For instance, the GM might rule that building a rope bridge over a chasm requires 40 man hours of Dex-based ordinary work, 24 hours of carpentry and eight man hours of engineer labor. 
 The normal limit on labor for each person involved is eight hours per 24 hour day. At the end of each day, each workers rolls his skill versus the SN of the task (Each skill may have a different SN, for example the Dex-based work for the bridge may be much easier than the engineering portion). A success puts eight man hours of work towards the task, a critical success count as 50% more. A failure counts half as much. A critical failure contributes nothing and RUINS 2d6 man-hours of work already done!
 A supervisor that works a FULL shift may instead of contributing directly instead organize and lead his workers. Make an Administration roll against the highest applicable SN. On a success, all workers gain a +2 to their work roll, +4 on a critical success. On any failure, the supervisor contributes nothing at all.
 It is possible to work longer shifts. NPCs refuse to work longer shifts. Roll against Vit on any day you work more than eight hours, a -1 per hour over 10. On a success, make the usual roll and (except on a critical failure) base the man-hours contributed on the time worked. On a failure, your skill roll takes a penalty of -1 per hour of overtime, and you lose FP equal to the size of your penalty - but you still contribute extra labor if your skill roll succeeds. Treat a critical failure as a normal failure except you are so tired you can't work at all the next day!
 It is possible to cut corners and reduce the man-hours of labor required, as described under Time Spent. All workers doing a given type of labor make their skill rolls at the usual penalty for haste. For instance, the manual laborers working on the rope bridge above could reduce their work to 20 man hours, but they would roll at -5. Cutting corners tends to also reflect somewhat on the quality of the final product.
 Likewise, it is possible to take extra time to get a bonus. For instance, if those laborers put in 80 man hours, they would roll at +1. This strategy is likely to backfire if the extra time takes the form of longer shifts, however.


-- Task Difficulty and Setting SN --

The SN is usually the ability of the object you are trying to affect to resist your manipulation, it is the number you must roll above with modifiers to succeed at your task. The absolute most basic of basic default SN is 10, representing a task an untrained monkey could succeed at half of the time. Here are some examples to help a GM get a grip for what a good SN for a situation might be.

 * Negative SN - 0: Automatic. The task is so trivially easy the GM shouldn't even bother to roll unless the character has some VERY inopportune modifiers. Examples: Hearing a pitched battle happening right in front of you, tracking 10 giants walking through deep mud.

 * 1-3: Trivial. Situations where failure is very unlikely, and would require incredible bad luck. GMs usually can also wave rolls here Examples: Jump onto a chair without falling, swim across a small and still lake.

 * 4-5: Very Easy. A day to day task, where failure is possible but very unlikely. Examples: Climb a knotted rope, hear a conversation through a wooden door.

 * 6-8: Easy. Most normal job tasks fall into this category, and few think much of attempting such tasks. Examples: Climb a tree with many branches, tie a firm knot.

 * 9-10: Favorable. A mildly risky task some might hesitate to attempt, but someone experienced can do rather easily. Examples: Competing in a community race, swimming across a river.

 * 11-12: Average. A typical adventuring task that most mundane people would rather avoid. Examples: Hitting an unarmored human in melee, break open a wooden door.

 * 13-15: Unfavorable. A difficult task that might make a novice adventurer hesitate, but an old hand could handle easily. Examples: Fly through a severe storm, hold onto a hydra's head.

 * 16-18: Very Unfavorable. A challenging endeavor even a veteran might hesitate to attempt. A true master is still unlikely to feel much challenge. Examples: Notice an invisible creature, strike a nearby flying bird with an arrow.

 * 19-20: Hard. An attempt that may begin to challenge a master. Examples: Jump over an Orc's head with a running start, climb a natural sheer wall.

 * 21-25: Very Hard. A situations that will give even a master second thoughts. Examples: Walking across a tightrope over a deep chasm while being shot at by multiple archers, fly through a hurricane.

 * 26-30: Lethal. Something so difficult any master would expect to fail, but still there are stories of great adventurers that have succeeded at such tasks. Examples: Climb from a dragon's gullet back into it's mouth, swordfight on a tightrope over a chasm while being shot by multiple archers.

* 31+: Epic. These tasks are so difficult, only creatures far beyond normal humans could think about succeeding at them regularly, GMs should not allow PCs to even roll against such a task unless they are unparalleled masters. Examples: Paint the equivalent of the Mona Lisa, strike a dragon's eye while it is in combat from a mountain top 500 ft away in a blizzard at night.


- Critical Success and Failure -

 When you roll a natural 20, you have a moment of great luck, the task you attempted works extraordinarily well. Some skills and effects list what happens when this occurs, sometimes the GM is asked to come up with something appropriate. In general, a nat 20 should mean you succeeded at the task by 50-100% more than usual, or in general, the most favorable realistically possible scenario occurs.
 There is a limit to this, though. If the SN of what you are attempting is equal or higher to your EFFECTIVE skill+25, you fail even on a natural 20, you cannot succeed at such a task AT ALL! Sometimes, the GM may also rule that you cannot succeed at a given task, and may forbid you to roll completely. A natural 20 is great luck, but not omnipotent, so never rely on it!
 Similarly, if your effective skill is equal or higher to the SN+20, you do not fail even on a nat 1. Treat it as a normal success, and you shouldn't bother rolling in such situations anyways. Also note that once taking 10 automatically succeeds at the task you're attempting, there is little reason not to use it whenever possible.


-- Degree of Success or Failure --

 Once you have calculated effective skill and SN, you roll the appropriate die (usually 1d20) to determine the outcome. If the total rolled is more than the SN, you succeed, if it is equal or less, you fail. The difference between the SN and your final roll is called your "margin of success" (or if appropriate, "margin of failure"). For example, if you rolled against SN 12, your effective skill is +3 and you roll a 5, you fail and your margin of failure is 4.
 Always note your margin of success or failure, as some rules use it to calculate effects. Even if the rules don't call for it, GMs are urged to reward large margins of success with particularly favorable outcomes, and large margins of failure with particularly disastrous outcomes! 


-- Repeated Attempts --

 Sometimes, you will only get one chance to do something (defuse a bomb, jump over a chasm, remove an inflamed appendix, appease the king with a song). Other times you can try over and over (pick a lock, catch a fish). Still other times you will not know whether you succeeded or failed until it is too late to try again (build a ship, order in a foreign restaurant, try to impress your date with your witty humor). Finally, there are times where you are injured for failing, but can afford to fail a few times (climb a wall, try to get to first base).
 The GM must use common sense to distinguish between these cases, according to the exact situation the PCs got into this time. As a rule:

 * If the first failure kills them or destroys the object of the attempt, that's that.
 * If a failure causes damage of some kind, assess the damage and let them try again after a "reasonable" time passes (Skill descriptions frequently state the time required).
 * If a failure causes no damage, let them try again after a reasonable time, but at -1 per repeated attempt - that is, -1 on the second attempt, -2 on the third, and so on - until they succeed or give up.
 * If repeated attempts are the norm for the task or if it's a long task, tell them that their attempt failed but let them try again at no special penalty, in the usual amount of time.


-- Contests --

 Sometimes a situation will arise in which two characters must compare attributes, skills, dick size or other traits to settle a competition. The one with the highest score doesn't ALWAYS win, but that's the way to bet. A "Contest" is a quick way to handle such a competitive situation without going too into detail.
 In a contest, each competitor attempts a roll with the ability being tested - with all applicable modifiers - and then compares his result to his opponent's. There are two different ways to make this comparison.

- Quick Contests -

A "Quick Contest" is a competition that is over in very little time, often in a second, or even instantly. Examples include two enemies lunging for a sword, or two knife throwers seeing who gets closer to the bull's-eye.
 Each competitor attempts his roll against the appropriate skill or attribute. The one with the highest roll overall wins, on a tie nobody won (in the examples above, both grabbed the sword at the same time, or the knives hit the same distance from the bull's-eye).
 The amount by which the winner beats the loser is often important - a roll of 15 verses 5 generally means much more than success of 20 vs 19! This is called the winner's "margin of victory" and is the winner's difference from the loser's roll. As a rule, the larger this is, the more clear the winner is.

 Resistance Rolls
 Most abilities that can affect an unwilling subject offer the subject an attempt to resist it using an attribute, skill or supernatural ability. This is usually a Quick Contest between the attacking ability and the defender's resistance, in which case two special rules apply:

 1. The attacker must succeed if he was trying an ability that has an SN to use. If a spellcaster rolls beneath his spell's SN, the spell fails and the subject need not make any roll to resist.
 2. The attacker must win to affect the subject. All ties go to the defender.

- Regular Contests -

 A "Regular Contest" is a slow competition with much give and take - for instance, arm wrestling.
 For such a contest, an SN is always set (if in doubt, 10 is a good default). Both roll with their appropriate skill or attribute against this SN. If one succeeds and one fails, the winner is obvious. If both succeed or both fail, the competitor's relative position is unchanged and they roll again. Eventually, one character succeeds when the other fails. At this point, the one who succeeded at his roll is the winner.
 The length of game time each attempt takes depends on the activity and is up to the GM. In a combat situation, each attempt tends to take a standard action...but in a library-research contest, with the fate of the world hanging on who finds a certain obscure reference first, each attempt could represent days of time.
