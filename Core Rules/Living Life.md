# Living Life in Neverwhere

 This document is meant to give you a cursory, completely non technical overview of just what it means to play Neverwhere, what is expected of you and your character, what options you have in terms of abilities and careers, and so on. This is meant to help you see the big picture, and decide whether Neverwhere sounds like a game you'd enjoy playing. No hard rules will be explained here, but links and references will be given to where the rules for a given thing can be found.


## The Big Picture: Daily Life

### Crash Course in Pen and Paper

 For those who have never even heard of a Pen and Paper game, here is the gist:
 You create a character, also called a Player Character or PC, according to certain rules. You then roleplay this character in the setting, talking to other people, fighting monsters, gathering items, etc.
 The rules handle how combat works, how making items work, and much much more. They are the tools you use to interact with the fictional world your character lives in.
 Interacting with other characters, such as talking or doing any other casual interaction (No one forbids you from going swimming with other characters, except maybe some monsters living in the lake that don't take kindly to skinny dipping), is usually only vaguely restricted by rules. You still can only use your abilities that your character by the rules is allowed to, but not every tiny action (such as how far you can skip a rock) is codified, that would be ludicrous! Instead, you and your fellow players are asked to just keep things reasonable and respect the boundaries of the game.
 You can imagine that we all are writing a very big book together, and we have certain rules we all agree to abide by so we don't step on each other's feet and mess things up. That's what these rules are for!
 In PnP, there is also a special type of player, called a Game Master or GM. GMs are the people that don't (only) play a character, but design the landscape, control monsters, give out items, etc. A GM is like an author of a book, and a player would be a protagonist (But a GM is not allowed to control other people's PCs, that's not fair!).
 Who can be a GM and how much a GM is allowed to do depends on the community you are playing with. Usually, for this type of game, there is one or a few "Over GMs", that created the game to begin with and that have the final word on things. They are sort of like Admins of the game, they can undo things they find bad, or add things they find good. In addition to this, many also allow other people to be GMs, but usually require new GMs to first prove their worth before they are allowed to do what they wish. Usually the Over GMs have lower GMs submit their ideas to them for approval, if they like what they see, they allow the lower GM to make his idea be part of the story. If they don't, they will probably help him fix it until it works.
 Almost always, adding things to an existing game without the consent of the Over GMs is strongly frowned upon, and could even get you banned! Always remember that playing Neverwhere is a privilege your Over GMs are working hard to grant you, you have no right to exhibit authority over the game they are running. If you disagree with how they do things, go start your own game! Complaining to them might work, but will probably just end in frustration for everyone.
 A special situation in which you are most likely to directly interact with a GM is called an "Adventure". Imagine an adventure to be, well, exactly what it sounds like. An especially cool, semi pre planned, piece of story. To allow players (who have life outside of the game) to take part in large numbers in especially cool events, GMs plan and announce adventures at given times. Say if in character, you were made aware of a nearby Goblin encampment, and you want to exterminate it. A GM might then set a day where he and other people have time, and let your party exterminate the Goblin camp at that day!
 Adventures are generally where the "beef" of story and combat happen. This is where you will find powerful items, fight monsters, learn about secret plots and possibly even die. 
 Unlike casual play, everything in an adventure is under direct GM supervision. So for example, you might say "I look to see what is behind that bush", and your GM will then explain to you what happens. Adventures then continue roughly in this action-reaction format until the end of this story. Afterwards, characters usually return back home to casual existence, but not always! You might be caught somewhere dangerous at the end of an adventure!
 Neverwhere has a very untypical aspect for PnP gaming: **One real life day equals one in game day.** You don't have to track it down to the hour, it's fine to decide that "this scene happened this morning" and "this one happened afterwards", but be careful to not mix up too many things! This direct ticking time can be stressful for planning and puts pressure onto people for regular maintenance of their character, which is intended, Neverwhere is not meant for everyone! In return, Neverwhere becomes a much longer game that can reward long term effort, which is very appealing to some people.
 Generally, the entire game will be a mix of these two main aspects. During the week traditionally, you spend most of your time socializing with other characters, crafting items, tending to your business and other such "low key" activities. And on the weekend, since that is usually when people have more free time, GMs will run adventures to keep the story exciting!
 How exactly your community organizes these things may be different, but that's the usual tried and true formula.

### The Player Character

 Gameplay in Neverwhere is focused around you as a player controlling one character, also called a Player Character or PC. You will decide how he acts, what he is capable of, and so on. In the game world, YOU are your character.
 Before you even start the game, you will have to make some decisions about your character. Is he strong? Or fast? Or smart? And many other things. While this is by far not all that will go into your character, your first choices will strongly influence his strengths' and weaknesses' down the line, so it is important that you at least have somewhat of an idea, what kind of character you will want to play.
 The Character Creation guide [CHAR DOC] has the rules you need to create your character, along with some discussion of what you might want to select depending on your playstyle. It is suggested you finish reading this doc though to get a more generic overview of the situation before you make your final decisions.

 It is suggested that you also consider that, like most roleplaying games, Neverwhere has a strong focus on story. You can and should consider what kinds of interesting stories you might be able to tell with your character, and plan your selection of traits at least roughly around that.


### Downtime: During the Week

 Traditionally in Neverwhere, your character spends most of the week doing "downtime" activities: Things that don't need your full attention as a player to transpire.
 This usually manifests through a Job. A job in terms of Neverwhere is an 8 hours a day activity or another that your character does while the player is not online (even so he is free to RP out his work day too, if he were so inclined). A character is usually required to have a job, he may face punishment if he is unwilling to work!
 Jobs generally fall into one of four categories:

*A **Crafting Job** is any job in which you take raw material and turn it into some refined item. This would include smithing, glassblowing and woodworking, but also things such as spell research. 

*A **Gathering Job** 'creates' value by gathering raw resources. This includes activities such as Herbalism, Foraging and Mining.

*An **Unskilled Job** is a job literally anyone can do, and doing it a lot won't make you much better at it. This includes timber and quarry work.

*A **Service Job** means that someone is willing to pay your character to do something not otherwise specified in the rules, such as working as a doctor or a painter.


 Crafting, Gathering and Unskilled jobs are strictly codified in rules how they work. It is clearly defined how much you can produce, and how much that produce is worth. You will use the bot to allow you to calculate how your job work goes.
 Service Jobs are uncodified, and are based on your ability to in game make deals with other characters to get payed.

 The deciding factor for your productivity at your job is usually your *skill*. The higher your skill, the faster and more productive you are at that activity. Every crafting and gathering job has it's own skill, which you can read about in [SKILL DOC].
 A character wanting to be very good at a job, such as wanting to be a master smith, will surely benefit from high skill, and probably high Dex and Int (since those are the two main attributes that determine most skills).

 Generally, you will want to start with an unskilled job, and once you have a better grip of the game, move to a gathering or crafting job. Or you could stay in an unskilled job forever, and make your fortune adventuring off the job!

 Most if not all jobs also have a "work site". This is where the character goes to work, and where his tools are if he is a crafter, or where he collects his resources if he is a gathere, or where he just does his labor if he is an unskilled worker.
 You too may build, run and profit from a work site. If you invest the effort into building a quarry, for example, you could hire other characters to work in that quarry as unskilled laborers. You could build an economic empire, in theory!
 You can of course own your own work site and work there, too.


 Beyond having a job, you can spend your down time resting and recovering from wounds, working on personal projects, hanging out with friends, getting into trouble, or anything else! You should be able to do just about anything you could in real life, too, but also with the consequences attached!
