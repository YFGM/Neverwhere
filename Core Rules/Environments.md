--- Verdant Forests, Howling Winds and Dark Dungeons: A Neverwhere Guide to Environments of All Kinds ---


 Almost nothing is as elemental as where you are. It determines how things look, how you can move, what you will find, it is so trivial, it is hardly worth mentioning. To help GMs have a repository of rules they may want to take their adventure wherever it needs to be, this guide was created. From the primal forests to the shivering cold of the mountain tops or the alien world of the cave systems, from rain and trees to lava and acid, you will find the help needed to take your adventuring party anywhere. This will include a terrain by terrain analysis of different areas and many mundane elements, but for now will serve as a repository of many environmental rules and effects. As always, what rules are in effect are up to the GM in any given situation, he is free to waive any rules he finds that would bog down his game.


-- Unusual Circumstances and Deadly Scenarios --

 Not only bandits, monsters and foul necromancers claim adventurers' lives, the environment itself can be the enemy! Here is a list of many common (and uncommon) dangerous scenarios characters might encounter in the wild, or even at home.


- Acid -

 Acids are corrosive chemicals that can disintegrate many things that come into contact with them into their component parts. They can range from fairly weak (citric acid is what makes your soda taste sour) to extremely potent (hydrofluoric acid can eat through almost every material known to man). For game purposes, treat strong alkalis just like strong acids. 
 Most laboratory acids are dangerous only to the eyes, but if you are splashed with a strong acid (such as from a volcanic pool of sulfuric acid), you take 1d4 corrosion damage. If a character's face is splashed, he must make a Vit SN 5 roll with a penalty equal to the damage took, on a failure the damage is to his eyes (See [COMBAT AND INJURY])! On a critical failure, the character's eyes are crippled. 
 If immersed in acid, a character takes 6d6 damage per round, and if his face is submersed, he must roll against eye damage every round! If a character swallows strong acid (for what reason he might do so is left to the imagination of the reader), he takes 3d6 damage at a rate of 1 HP per 10 minutes. A successful SN 10 Physician roll and 5$ of activated charcoal can stop this damage from continuing. Each attempt takes 5 minutes. Note that acids taste and often smell extremely strong, any character sipping a drink poisoned with acid will immediately spit it out, taking 1 HP of damage, unless he tries to force it down.
 Used against a lockpin or other vulnerable item, a vial of acid will burn through it in 1d20 minutes. It may require a Chemistry roll to identify what acid you are dealing with and whether it can do the job.
 A single vial of acid strong enough to be used as a splash weapon or to dissolve a small lock costs $10.


- Atmosphere -

 The very air around you that you breathe can be your greatest enemy. Normal living creatures are fine tuned to an atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen and oxygen, with a pressure of around 1 atm and few toxic impurities. An atmosphere that differs too much from this norm can be extremely deadly. This is a relatively rare hazard outside of poison gas traps, dangerous underground tunnels, laboratory accidents and alien planets.

 - Atmospheric Pressure -
 Regardless of composition, it may be difficult or impossible to breathe in an atmosphere with a very different pressure. Only strong magic or a pressure suit can protect adventurers from these effects. Atmospheric pressure is measured in atm, 1 atm is air pressure at sea level on Earth.

 Trace (up to 0.01atm): The atmosphere is so thin, treat it as a vacuum (See Vacuum, further down). This is normally found close to what would be considered "outer space".
 Very Thin (0.02 to 0.5atm): The air is too thin to breathe. Earth's atmosphere becomes this thin above 6km. If you lack protection, you suffocate (See Suffocation further down). All vision Per rolls take -4 without protective goggles. This kind of pressure is found on the highest of mountains, and can be encountered by extreme mountaineering and flying characters.
 Thin (0.51-0.8atm): Earth's atmosphere is thin between 2km and 6km. If Earth levels of oxygen are present, this atmosphere is breathable, but hard on unprotected individuals. Whenever you lose one or more FP due to exertion, you lose an additional FP. All vision based Per rolls are at -2 without goggles. Finally, any character that breathes a thin atmosphere for at least 1 hour must roll a SN 5 Vit roll once per day. Critical success means acclimatization, no need to roll anymore until the character spends at least 1 week outside of a thin atmosphere and returns. Success means no effects today. On a failure the character suffers nausea, headaches, etc, giving him -2 on Dex and Int. On a critical failure, he falls into a coma after 1d6 hours, treat this as a normal coma, including death roles, regardless of HP. The patient won't recover unless brought to normal pressure for at least one hour (an air tank would do too), or receives long term or intensive care (see First Aid and Physician skill) for at least 5 or 1 hour, respectively. Most mountain dwelling and flying creatures are always acclimatized to these altitudes. This is a common threat to characters traveling the mountains or that fly high above the clouds.
 Normal (0.81-1.20atm): The standard atmospheric pressure, normal characters can breathe just fine, only some exotic species may have difficulties.
 Dense (1.21-1.5atm): Generally dense atmospheres are safer than trace atmospheres. The air is breathable, with some discomfort. All characters without a pressure suit suffer -1 Vit, and if the oxygen level is over 50% (might happen on say, a submarine), must wear "reducing respirators" or suffer -2 Dex to coughing and lung damage.
 Very Dense (1.51+ atm): As dense atmosphere, but a reducing respirator is REQUIRED to breathe if the oxygen level is over 10%. This kind of atmosphere is usually only found in extremely exotic situations.
 Superdense (10+ atm): As very dense, but the pressure is so high it may CRUSH an unprotected character. See Pressure further down. Such effects are exceedingly rare on a normal habitable planet, and only exist in complex experiments or weird magical effects. Visitors to a gas giant such as Jupiter though might encounter pressures of HUNDREDS of atm!

 - Hazardous Atmospheres -

 Not all atmospheres are filled with the relatively benign nitrogen and oxygen. Poison gas weapons, underground gas bubbles, noxious magical attacks and industrial catastrophes can create such atmospheres on a localized scale. Note that many dangerous gases are heavier than air and can accumulate on the ground or in pits, forming lethal concentrations!

 Corrosive: The very atmosphere reacts with exposed flesh. A character in a sealed suit might be safe, but the gases may eat away at seals. Small concentrations of corrosive gases such as ammonia and nitrides in the atmosphere (a worst-possible-case-scenario for fertilizer factories) call for a Fort roll with SN 5-15 once per minute to avoid 1 point of corrosive damage. Victims suffer coughing (see [STAT CONDS]) after losing 1/3 of their HP, and blindness after losing 2/3 of their HP. Atmospheres comprised primarily of corrosive chemicals count as immersion in acid (see above) AND are suffocating (see below)! Gases such as Fluorine and Chlorine are EXTREMELY corrosive AND toxic!
 Toxic: Chemicals in the air threaten any character that breathes. A character breathing in this atmosphere without a suitable respirator must make a Fort roll at a regular interval to avoid toxic damage. This can range from SN 5, once per day, 1HP for regular industrial pollutants to SN 25, once per round, 6d6 HP for nerve gas! If such gases make up most of the atmosphere, the damage is at LEAST 1d6 per round, with no Fort roll possible, and counts as suffocating. A character can hold their breathe to avoid these effects if the poison doesn't penetrate the skin (As say, nerve gas, does). A typical poisonous gas is carbon monoxide (a great danger to miners!). Chlorine and Fluorine are toxic in tiny concentrations, and also corrosive.
 Suffocating: The atmosphere lacks the oxygen necessary to breathe. Any without a magical or technological source of oxygen begin to suffocate (see further down). Carbon dioxide, methane, and any other gas that can displace oxygen is suffocating. Methane or carbon dioxide bubbles have cost more than one miner their lives! If the suffocating gas only displaces the oxygen partially, characters instead roll Fort against SN 10 every 10 minutes, losing 1 FP on a failure. The insidious danger is that a character IC cannot distinguish this loss from normal exhaustion, and must roll a SN 15 Int check to realize something is wrong! He may attempt this roll every 10 minutes, and may substitute Chemistry or Mining for the Int check, if he has those skills. If a character falls unconscious in such an atmosphere, he begins losing 1 HP per 10 minutes until saved! This is why some miners take a Canary or other small animal with them to the mines, as it will fall unconscious much faster than a miner will and alerts them to the presence of dangerous gases. Atmospheres composed mostly of corrosive or toxic gases also count as suffocating, but usually kill their victims so quickly the suffocation becomes irrelevant.


- Avalanches -

 The high peaks and heavy snowfall of large mountains make them prone to avalanches, gigantic and incredibly deadly waves of snow and ice. While avalanches of snow and ice are the most common, avalanches made of rock and soil (sometimes called a landslide) are also possible, and avalanches composed of mud (also called mudslides) are common in some rainy areas.
 An avalanche begins somewhere along a mountainside, and can be spotted by a character from 1d10x150m away with a SN 15 Per check. If all characters in a party fail to notice an approaching avalanche, it moves closer to them, and they automatically (unless blind and deaf, which if is the case one must wonder why they are hiking along a dangerous trail to begin with) notice the unmistakable shaking and rumbling once it closes half the original distance. It's possible to hear an avalanche if you can't see it. Under optimum conditions (no other loud noises occurring), a character who makes a SN 10 Per check can hear the ominous rumbling of an approaching avalanche when it is 1d6x150m away. This SN might be 15, 20 or even higher in conditions where hearing is difficult (such as in the middle of a thunderstorm). You may substitute Survival for either of these Per checks.
 A landslide or avalanche consists of two distinct parts: the bury zone (in the direct path of the falling debris) and the slide zone (the area the debris spreads out to encompass). Characters in the bury zone always take damage, characters in the spread zone might be able to get away. Anyone caught in the bury zone takes 8d6 damage as they are torn down the slope with the avalanche, or half on a successful SN 15 Re check. They are subsequently buried. On a critical success on the Re check, they take no damage but are still buried. Characters in the slide zone take 3d6 damage, or no damage on a successful SN 15 Re check. Those who fail the check are buried.
 Buried characters lose 1d4 FP per minute (more than cave ins because avalanches don't permit air to reach the character). If a character falls unconscious, they begin losing HP as normal (see [COMBAT AND INJURY]). Digging out a character functions like under Cave Ins (see below), but you work at BLx60 l/h if it was a snow; BLx30 if it was a soil or mud, or BLx15 if it was a rock avalanche. If you can find where in an avalanche a character is buried, you can dig straight down 1d3 meters to reach him. Doing so requires a SN 20 Per check, which needs 5 minutes to attempt and may be substituted by a Survival check. Similar to a cave in, your chances of saving a buried friend are extremely low unless you are unusually well prepared.
 A typical avalanche has a width of 1d6x30m. The bury zone is located in the center and has a width half as wide as the avalanches full width, with the rest of the edges being the slide zone. To determine where a random avalanche hits a party, roll 1d4. On a 1 or 2, everyone is in the bury zone, on a 3, half the party is in the bury zone and half is in the slide zone, and on a 4 everyone is in the slide zone. Avalanches of snow and ice move at 150m per round, while rock and soil travel at 100m per round.


- Cave-Ins and Collapses -

 A great danger to any spelunker or miner alike, a cave in is probably the worst thing that could happen to you while deep underground (other than maybe tunneling into a dragon's nest). Not only is an unfortunate subterranean dweller faced with the danger of being crushed by tons of rock, but even if they survive they might be buried beneath a pile of rubble or cut off from the only known exit. 
 A cave in buries anyone in the immediate collapsing area, and then sliding debris damages anyone in the periphery. A typical corridor subjected to a cave in might have a 5m radius bury zone and a 3m sliding zone extending beyond that. If actively looking for a weakened ceiling, a character can roll a SN 20 Per check to spot such a danger, or a SN 15 Mining or Engineering (Mining) roll. A weaken ceiling might collapse when subjected to a major impact or concussion (such as a foolish PC using explosives). A character can cause a collapse by destroying half the pillars holding up the ceiling, or dealing at least 200 points of damage to a natural wall (Note that a natural stone wall has DR 15/bludgeoning and 5/-). 
 Characters in the bury zone of a collapse take 8d6 points of damage, or half that amount on a successful SN 15 Re roll, with no damage on a critical success. They are subsequently buried, unless they critically succeeded on their Re roll. Characters in the slide zone take 3d6 damage, or no damage at all on a successful SN 15 Re roll. Characters in the slide zone that fail their Re roll are buried.
 An unfortunate entombed character loses 1d4 FP per 10 minutes while buried. If he falls unconscious, the FP damage continues as normal until he is freed or dead. Remember that such damage starts to affect HP (see [COMBAT AND INJURY])!
 Characters who are not buried can dig out their friends. This functions similarly to normal digging (see [ADVANCED ACTIONS]), except you work at BLx5 l/h without tools and at BLx15 l/h with pick, crowbar or shovel. Every meter dug towards an ally is the equivalent of 3500 liters. A buried character may attempt a SN 25 Str check to free himself once every 10 minutes, bringing him to the edge of the cave in.
 Sadly, it is extremely unlikely you will be able to get to your buried friend before he perishes, unless you have an entire mining team or magic on hand. So are the dangers of the underground.


- Cold -

 Very low temperatures can be as deadly as any sword, and can slowly whittle away at the stamina of even mighty adventurers. Travelers are well advised to come prepared when entering an area known for cold weather. These effects are meant for sustained ambient low temperatures, not localized cold attacks that may be the effect of spells or monsters.

 - Temperature -
 The most important factor is the actual temperature, which is divided into categories. Each category has different effects on characters caught in it without adequate protection (see further down). Any FP lost to cold can only be recovered in a warm environment.
 
 Cold: 5 to -15 °C
 Severe Cold: -15 to -30 °C
 Extreme Cold: -30 to -45 °C
 Unearthly Cold: -45°C or less
 
 Cold: Unprotected characters must make a SN 5 Fort roll, which increases by 1 for each hour spent in the cold, every hour, or lose 1 FP. Characters whose protection level is at least 1 are safe at this temperature.
 
 Severe Cold: Unprotected PCs must make a roll as under Cold, but once every 10 minutes (the SN increases every roll). Partially protected characters need only roll once per hour. A character with level 2 protection or higher is fully protected, a level 1 protected character counts as partially protected.
 
 Extreme Cold: Unprotected characters take 1d4 HP damage per 10 minutes, with no roll to resist. In addition, they must make a roll as under cold vs SN 15 (increasing again by 1 for each roll) to resist losing 1 FP every 10 minutes. Any character wearing uninsulated metal armor takes an additional 1 point of lethal damage every 10 minutes, and 1d6 lethal damage from ripping skin if they attempt to take off the armor without warming it first. A partially protected character takes damage and needs to roll only every hour. A level of protection of 3 or higher is required to be safe, 2 is considered partially protected, and 1 offers no protection.
 
 Unearthly Cold: Unprotected creatures take 1d4 points of damage and lose 1d4 FP per minute with no roll to resist. Partially protected characters take damage once per hour instead of once per minute. Level 4 protection is required for full protection, level 2 or 3 is considered partial protection, and level 1 offers no protection.
 
- Temperature Variations -

 Some conditions can make low temperatures "more effective", making the effects "drop" one or more categories (e.g. if you are in a Severe Cold environment, the effects become that of Extreme Cold if there are severe winds):

 High Altitude: Generally, higher altitudes drop the cold level down one category starting at 1500m, and then by two starting at 5000m.
 
 Wind Chill: High winds don't actually cool down the temperature per se, but makes the body lose more heat, making the effects drop one category if Severe or higher winds are blowing (See Weather below).
 
 Water: Water is incredibly dangerous at cold temperatures, as it can quickly sap the heat from a body, causing thermal shock. A character suddenly immersed into cold water must roll an immediate Fort check against SN 15. On a failure, he loses 1d6 FP. Afterwards, he must roll against the normal cold effects of the ambient temperature once per round, at a -10 penalty. This -10 penalty remains as long as the character is wet in the cold.
 
 - Temperature Protection -
 
 Humans, having mostly evolved in the scorching heat of Africa, by default have no protection to cold. An animal with thick fur, or a furless animal native to cold terrain, has a default protection level of 1. An arctic animal with fur or a monster native to arctic terrain generally has 2 and a magical creature native to the arctic usually has 3 or better. The following things can modify this protection (they all stack unless otherwise noted):
 
 Cold Winter Clothing (+1 Protection)
 Heavy Furs (+1): Can be stacked on top of Cold Winter Clothing or armor, but give a -2 armor check penalty.
 Having the Cold Tolerance Perk (+1)
 Insulated Armor (+1): Doesn't stack with Cold Winter Clothes, stacks with heavy furs.
 Improvised Shelter (+3): If one does not attempt to move but instead tries to make a fire, dig a cave, etc, see the Survival skill ([SKILLS]).
 
 - Frostbite -
 Being exposed to great cold can numb one's limbs. If a character takes any FP damage from cold, they are affected by frostbite and take -2 on all Dex rolls until they recover the FP lost to cold.
 
 - Hypothermia -
 Hypothermia is a potentially fatal condition caused by the lowering of the internal body temperature and can occur from any exposure to cold. The condition is marked by pale skin, rigid muscles and loss of consciousness. 
 Whenever a character loses at least 1/4 of his FP from cold, he is affected by mild hypothermia. This has no effect beyond some mild shaking and pale skin, yet. 
 Any character that has lost at least 1/2 of his FP to cold is affected by moderate hypothermia, taking a -6 penalty to all Dex rolls as his body becomes hard to move and stiff. At this time, the character will have an overwhelming urge to lay down and go to sleep, requiring a SN 10 Will roll every hour to resist. It is important to stop him from doing so, as he will most likely freeze to death. 
 Any character that loses more than 3/4 of their total FP to cold is affected by severe hypothermia, causing him to curl up and try to sleep, all muscles too rigid to move. He is treated as unconscious and needs help. 
 Hypothermia disappears as lost FP are regained. Remember that FP lost to cold can only be recovered while in a warm environment (and not wearing cold wet clothes).


- Concealment and Cover -

 When in combat (or a stealth situation) an object between you and your enemy can hinder either one or both of you if it's in the way, causing either Concealment or Cover. In general, to use a Stealth roll, you must have either concealment or cover, but not always.
 If an object or effect hampers only line of sight (aka your ability to see your target, or use whatever other primary sense you uses, always sight in PC case), but still gives you unhindered physical access to their position, such as caused by thick smoke or fog, they are said to "have concealment". Whenever you strike such a creature, you must roll a d100 against your concealment % to hit. In general, normal concealment gives a 20% miss chance, aka you misses on a roll of 1-20. This is IN ADDITION to your normal roll to hit. Some spells and other effective sources of concealment may provide "improved concealment", giving a 30% miss chance or similar.
 If you cannot see an enemy at all, they are said to "have total concealment". You cannot target such a foe directly, but can attack the area in which you think they stand. If you target the correct square, you may attack with your attack having a 50% concealment miss chance. You cannot execute attacks of opportunity against a foe that has total concealment to you.
 Note that not all concealments always count. A character with darkvision can ignore concealment given by darkness, a monster with tremorsense could ignore any concealment as long as it's prey is in contact with the ground! Invisible creatures have total concealment, but foes may roll Per to spot such a creature, but the invisible target gains a +20 to Stealth rolls to remain undetected, +40 if they remain stationary.
 If an object or effect hinders not (only) line of sight but line of effect (your ability to directly hit the target), they are said to "have cover". A creature can have partial cover, cover, improved cover or total cover.
 A creature that is more than half exposed can at most have "partial cover". This grants them +2 to AC and +1 to Re to resist enemy effects. A creature with a good surface to hide behind, such as a human behind a normal sized tree, can gain cover, granting +4 to AC and +2 to Re to resist enemy effects. In some cases, when a character has a very good hiding point, such as from behind an arrow slit, they gain "improved cover". This gives the hiding one +8 to AC, +4 to Re to resist enemy effects and +10 to Stealth. A creature to which you have no way to directly affect is said to have "total cover", and cannot be targeted by most of your mundane abilities (But some spells might go through walls, for example).
 If the obstructing object is not a rigid and strong object for which one would normally not count damage, such as a wall, but is instead most definitely breakable, such as an ally warrior between you and the foe, you are said to have "soft cover", which grants normal +4 to AC, but no bonus to Re. Note that some effects with a spread can move around corners and ignore this Re bonus! You can never make attacks of opportunity against a foe that has cover towards you.
 In general, similar to tactical combat in general, when a battlemap is not in use, the GM's word counts for whether cover is granted or not.


- Electricity -

 A rare threat outside of modern worlds, but existent, electricity varies WIDELY in it's effects, ranging from momentary shock to instant death! An uninsulated character (rubber gloves tend to protect against all but the worst electricity) touching anything under a non magical electric current (or even coming near very high voltage currents!) is shocked as per these rules. Magical electricity attacks function completely independently of these rules. Wearing metallic armor or other things that conduct electricity good gives you -4 on all Vit rolls! Electricity falls into two categories, non lethal and lethal.

 Non Lethal: High voltage, low power shocks are unlikely to kill, but can stun characters or even render them unconscious and generally are a VERY uncomfortable experience. Examples include electric stun weapons, electric fences or a critical failure on a Mechanic (Electric) roll. A character zapped rolls Fort against SN 10 with a bonus or penalty ranging from +4 for a short circuited battery to -4 or more for a specifically designed stun weapon. Non-metallic armor grants a bonus to this roll equal to it's AC bonus. On a failure, the character is stunned ([STAT CONDS]) for one round, and may then reroll the same Fort roll once per round until he recovers. A continuous shock keeps the victim stunned as long as he is in contact with the source, and for 1d6 rounds afterwards. Note that characters stunned by electricity tend to clench up and may keep holding on to whatever caused the shock, and touching a character being shocked will affect the wanna be helper! On a critical failure on the first Fort roll, the victim instead falls unconscious for 1d4 hours and loses 1d6 FP.

 Lethal: High power shocks can burn flesh and even stop a victim's heart! This includes things such as power mains and natural lightning. A lethal shock inflicts burning damage, from 1d3 to 3d6 for most household disasters, over 6d6 for a power line, to 2000d12 for a natural lightning bolt. A victim that took any damage must immediately make a SN 10 Fort roll with a penalty equal to half the damage received. On a failure, he falls unconscious for as long as he is in contact with the source and for 1d4 hours afterwards, and loses 1d8 FP. A failure by 5 or more or a critical failure causes a heart attack ([STAT CONS]).

 Natural Lightning: While an iconic story, being struck by lightning is ridiculously rare, and lethal. In a normal thunderstorm, a GM should not even bother to check whether lightning strikes a PC. If a PC is REALLY asking for it, walking around in metal armor on a high peak holding his hands high or whatever, the GM may roll a d20 once per 10 minutes. On a nat1, roll another d20. If that TOO is a nat 1, lightning strikes the character. If he is grounded, he may roll Vit against SN 15. On a success the lightning passes through him almost completely, dealing only 1d6 damage. On a failure, he is burned but still the vast majority of the lightning passes through him, dealing 4d6 damage. On a critical failure, or if he is not properly grounded, the unfortunate creature is instantly disintegrated into a lump of coal, for 2000d12 damage. For sake of simplicity, flying characters should not be considered targets for lightning.


- Falling -

 Finding yourself in mid air without a means to fly can be quite the dangerous situation. A character takes 1d6 of bludgeoning damage per 3m fallen once he contacts the ground, to a maximum of 20d6 damage. 
 To not need terminal velocity calculations, assume that a characters falls 60m per round, or 10m per second. This is oversimplifying as a character's terminal velocity is closer to 55m/s, but it takes a few seconds to reach that. If a character is caught in the air for more than 2 or three rounds, assume that he is moving at 55m/s, or 330m per round.
 Generally for most falls, assume a character will only have an immediate action worth of time to react. An Acrobatics, Flying or Telekinesis roll (requiring an immediate action to attempt) can save you or at least dampen the fall, see the appropriate skill descriptions ([SKILLS]). Falling on to an enemy deals damage equal to half what the faller received to whatever the character fell on. 
 Falling on to a soft surface such as mud makes the fall deal 1d6 less damage, and falling into water halves the effective length fallen on a successful SN 10 Acrobatics check.
 These rules assume something roughly human shaped and weight, a heavier object will both receive and deal more damage, and a larger object will tend to have a lower maximum damage (unless also heavy, compare a parachute to a boulder for example).


- Fire -

 You're not an adventurer until you've been set on fire at least once. Fire can be encountered in form of attacks such as burning arrows or Molotov cocktails, or natural hazards such as forest fires or burning buildings, and over all is something you generally don't want on your body. Note that magical fire abilities usually function completely separate from these rules, see their individual descriptions.
 Spending part of your turn in a normal fire or moving through it causes 1d3 burning  damage. Spending an entire round in a flame, or on fire, deals 1d6 burning damage. Very intense flames such as a furnace may deal 3d6 or even more damage per round. Fire can also ignite other objects and make breathing difficult. Boiling water deals 1d6 points of damage, unless a character is fully immersed, in which case it deals 10d6 of damage per round.

 - Making Things BURN -

 Items are grouped into six groups of flammability, depending on how much damage is needed to ignite them:

 Super Flammable (e.g. black powder, ether): Negligible damage (candle flame).
 Highly Flammable (e.g. alcohol, paper, tinder): 1 point.
 Flammable (e.g. dry wood, kindling, oil): 3 points.
 Resistant (e.g seasoned wood, clothing, rope, leather): 10 points.
 Highly Resistant (e.g. green wood, flesh): 30 points.
 Non Flammable (e.g. brick, metal, rock): N/A

 Any burning attack that deals the listed amount of damage in a SINGLE attack ignites the material. If a flame fails to ignite the material, but could do so on it's best roll, if you really care, you can continue rolling until it does ignite the material. Even if a fire could not ignite a material on it's best damage roll, it might still do so with prolonged contact. Roll d20 for every minute of contact, on a 15 it succeeds at igniting a material one category "too high" (e.g. flammable material taking 1 point of damage per second), or ignites a material up to two categories "too high" on a 20 (e.g. dry wood touching a candle flame).
 Once a material is burning, it may ignite adjacent material if it's fire's damage is high enough (1d6 damage for a normal flame).

 - Catching on Fire -

 When wearing clothing, a SINGLE attack that deals at least 3 points of burning damage will ignite part of it. This deals 1d6-4 (minimum 0) damage to the character per round, and is distracting, giving a -2 to Dex unless the flame cannot harm the character (If he for example has DR 2 (Fire) or better). A character can pat out this fire using a move action and a successful SN 5 Dex roll.
 A single burning attack that deals at least 10 points of damage ignites all a character's clothing, which deals 1d6-1 damage per round and is VERY distracting, giving a -4 on Dex for everything except attempting to put out the fire. A character must roll on the ground to put out this fire, which takes a full round action and a successful SN 10 Acrobatics roll and leaves him prone. Jumping into water immediately extinguishes any burning clothes.
 This assumes ordinary (linen, cotton, etc) clothes. Clothing that is wet or worn under armor is almost impossible to ignite, and so is armor. On the other hand, fancy dresses, lace cuffs, etc ignite if they take even 1 point of burning damage!

 - Large Fires -

 Large fires, such as burning buildings or forest fires, bring with them even more dangers to characters caught within, in the form of choking smoke and air so scalding hot it deals damage. 
 Whenever a character is caught in an area where a very large flame rages nearby, or the majority of the area is alight, he takes 1d4 of damage per minute from breathing the air, 1d4-2 if he holds his breathe.
 Large fires tend to produce a lot of smoke, requiring a character caught in the plumes to roll Fort versus SN 10 + 1 per previous check, per minute or start coughing ([STAT CONS]). A character that coughs for more than 2 minutes loses 1 FP per additional minute spent coughing. Smoke obscures vision and grants anyone within concealment.
 These effects are in addition to the normal damage one would take from being exposed to fire. Note also that burning buildings weaken and collapse as they burn.

 Forest Fires: A devastating natural disaster, forest fires are huge infernos of burning wood occurring when conditions are dry, winds are strong and the forest floor is dry and flammable. Lightning strikes in such conditions often start these disasters, and travelers may be caught in the conflagration.
 Forest fires can be spotted from up to 2d6x30m away by a character making a SN 10 Per roll. If all characters fail their Per roll, the fire moves closer to them. They automatically see it when it closes half the original distance. With proper elevation, the smoke from a forest fire can be spotted from up to 15km away. Characters blinded or otherwise unable to make Per checks automatically feel the heat of the fire when it is 30m away.
 The leading edge of a fire (the downwind side) can advance faster than a human can run (assume 40m per round for wind of moderate strength). Once a particular section of a forest is set ablaze, it remains so for 2d4x10 minutes before dying to a smoking wasteland. Characters overtaken by a forest fire might find the leading edge of the fires advancing away from them faster than they can keep up, trapping them deeper and deeper within it's grasp.
 In all other ways, a forest fire works like any other large fire.


- Getting Lost -

 Almost trivial sounding at first to a mighty adventurer, getting lost in the wild can be at the very least very embarrassing and at worst turn a trek into the woods into a hard pressed bid for survival. These rules are optional and can be used for extended wilderness trek PnPs, if the GMs and PCs don't mind a possible severe derailing.
 Following an obvious road, trail, or feature such as a streambed or shoreline prevents a party from getting lost, but travelers striking out cross country might become disorientated easier than they'd think, especially in conditions of poor visibility or difficult terrain.
 Whenever a group is wandering in an unknown area cross country with no clear land marks to follow, they may need to roll to not err off course. Once per hour in which the group travels in a forest, moor, hill or mountain terrain, or in any terrain during conditions where they cannot see further than 20m (such as during heavy rain or darkness), the character leading the group must roll Survival to avoid getting lost. The SN depends on the terrain type, with a +4 if the leader has proper navigation tools (such as a sextant and map), and a -4 if visibility is poor.

Terrain				SN
Desert or Plains		12
Forest				15
Moor or hill			8
Mountain			10
Open sea			20
Urban, ruins or dungeon		5

 On a failed Survival roll, the group becomes lost. They begin walking in a random direction but themselves do not notice it. This random movement continues until the party blunders onto a recognizable landmark or until they recognize they are lost and regain their bearings.
 Every hour spent lost, every character in the group rolls a Survival roll against SN 15 - 1 per hour of random travel. On a success they notice they are not anymore sure they are moving in the right direction. They may then attempt a Survival roll SN 15 + 2 per hour of random travel to regain their bearings and correct their course. If a character fails this check, they select a random direction as the "correct" direction for resuming travel. They may then still get lost later as described above whether their new direction is right or wrong, of course. It is also possible that multiple characters will fail their roll and have conflicting opinions of what direction is the right one. The GM should simply tell the players which direction they think is right, with no word on whether it actually is or not.


- Heat -

 The life giving rays of the sun can also be one's bane, burning and desiccating anyone alive that dared venture into a sun scorched wasteland without adequate protection. These rules are meant for sustained ambient high temperatures, not for localized extreme heat. See Fire for more on how that works, but note that magical effects still function completely separately. Hot temperatures fall into multiple levels, each having different effects and needing different levels of protection to brave, as described below. Note that FP lost to heat can only be recovered in a cool, shaded environment, and that in hot weather, a character's need for fluid triples, and it quintuples in severe or higher heat.

6C to 15C	Moderate
16C to 30C	Warm
31C to 45C	Hot
46C to 60C	Severe Heat
61C to 80C	Extreme Heat
81C to 100C	Unearthly Heat
101C or higher	Burning Heat

 Hot: As long as you stay mostly in the shade and unmoving, you are fine at these temperatures. If you are very active though, roll a Fort roll against SN 10 + 1 per hour spent in the heat and -1 per level of encumbrance, once per hour. Wearing armor or heavy clothes gives you a -4 on this roll. On a failure, you lose 1 FP. On a critical failure, you suffer a heat stroke, losing 1d6 FP. Level 1 protection or higher is sufficient to be protected from this heat.

 Severe Heat: As under Hot, but you must make the roll once per 10 minutes. In addition, you lose an additional FP whenever you lose FP to exertion or dehydration. A character with level 2 protection is safe at these temperatures, a character with level 1 protection is only partially protected, having to make the roll only once per hour.

 Extreme Heat: As under Severe Heat, except that you automatically lose 1d4 HP per hour, in addition to the roll. Anytime you lose FP to exertion or dehydration, you lose an additional 2 FP. Any character coming into contact with a metal object that was in this heat for an extended period of time take 1d3 burning damage from the contact (wearers of metal armor take this damage once per minute). Level 3 protection is necessary to survive this weather unharmed, level 2 protection gives partial protection, sparing you the HP damage and requiring you to roll only once per hour, while level 1 protection does nothing.

 Unearthly Heat: These extreme temperatures are inimical to all normal life. As Extreme Heat, but any unfortunate unprotected creature in this area loses 1d4 HP and 1d4 FP per round, with no roll to resist. Only level 4 protection can shield one from these effects, level 2 or 3 count as partial protection, making the damage occur only once per 10 minutes, while level 1 protection does nothing.

 Burning Heat: Eventually, heat becomes so intense, water starts to boil and skin to burn. In addition to any effects of very high temperature on one's equipment (high temperatures could ignite lamp oil, for example) any character in this heat takes 3d10 burning damage per round with no roll to resist. In general, non high-tech or supernatural defenses are useless against this kind of heat.

 - Temperature Variation -

 A few situations can further increase (or decrease) the temperature of a specific area, either directly or only "effectively":

 Altitude: Temperature tends to be lower higher up, and as described under Cold, the higher you climb the colder it gets, and vice versa as well. In addition to the effects listed under Cold, 100m or more below sea level tends to also increase the heat by one level.
 Moving deeper into the earth can also increase the temperature a lot as the pressure on the rocks around you increase. This increase is generally around 1C per 30m one ventures down, but can be much quicker in areas of geothermal activity such as magma pockets or hot springs.

 Night: When people think of the desert, they think of shimmering heat and blazing sun. These things exist, during the day. Once night falls, the dried out and flat land can lose it's heat at a frightening speed. A few hours after sunset, a desert tends to drop two or even three or four levels in heat. It is very possible to freeze to death in a desert, see the effects of Cold above.

 Noon: Often an area's hottest period is at noon and a few hours afterwards, making stones hot enough to cook food and produce burns. This can increase the temperature level by one level compared to the day average, in some areas even by two levels.

 Wind: While a cool breeze can be a blessing on a hot day, many warm wastelands have hot, dry winds that actually make the heat worse. A furnace gale blowing over a wasteland doesn't only heat the air, but also drags away precious moisture from the skin. This causes the body to constrict outer skin blood vessels, increasing core temperature and increasing the risk for heat stroke. A warm or hot wind of at least strong strength or stronger raises the effect of the ambient temperature by one level, without actually increasing the temperature.

 - Temperature Protection -

 Only a fool would brave the heat without adequate protection. This protection is measured in levels, and unless otherwise noted (or if it doesn't make sense), the effects stack. The heat levels above note what levels are required to be safe. Cold blooded creatures usually always have a base protection level of 1, and creatures native to hot terrains usually have level 2 or better.

 Having the Heat Tolerance Perk (+1)
 Dousing yourself regularly with large amounts of water (Uses about 30l of water per person per day, +1)
 Desert Outfit (+1)
 Improvised Shelter (See Survival, +3)


- Suffocation -

 Humans belong to a weird group of things called "living creatures" and therefor need a magical substance known as "oxygen" to function. If for some reason you should be unable to breathe in oxygen (poison gas trap, underwater, sexual kinks taken too far etc), you can hold your breathe for a number of rounds equal to your Vit score. After that, you start losing 1d6 FP per round until you can breathe again. Once your FP reaches 0, you must roll Will as normal to resist falling unconscious, which can be especially deadly if you then can't get yourself out of the suffocating area. You continue losing FP (and HP!) as normal. No matter FP and HP, a character dies after 4 minutes of no oxygen.
 A character starts recovering FP again at his normal rate once he is again breathing clean air. Unconscious characters reawaken once their FP reaches 1.
