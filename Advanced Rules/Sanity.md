--- The Voices Told Me To Write This Guide: Sanity and Insanity ---


 You check the door to make sure it's locked. It's locked. You turn away look to the table. Are you sure you locked the door? You check again. It's locked. What was that noise? You look around. Nothing. You check the door again. It's locked. Another sound, you look outside through the curtains. It's your neighbor's daughter, smiling and skipping, a fresh baked apple pie in her hand, on her way to your door. You love apple pie. You sneer, haha, she actually thinks you don't know the cake is poisoned, and that they're trying to kill you. But you know, oh you know better. And she will soon too. She knocks on the door. You slowly reach for the knife on the table...


 You have seen things. Friends torn to shreds, horrible monsters that stalk the night, mind bending magic and twisted nightmares. And they have left a mark on your very mind. Every character has a certain level of "Sanity" (or San), which slowly decreases as he is exposed to terrible events and some other effects. As a character's San decreases, he becomes more and more unstable, sometimes dangerous, sometimes 'just' suicidal. Recovering San can be a difficult and long process, but sometimes, those voices in your head just have such good ideas, why would you want them gone?


-- A Word on Realism --

 As all should (hopefully) be aware of, we are playing a game here. Games aren't supposed to be 100% realistic, they're supposed to be fun. So in that sense, it should be obvious but I would like to say that the effects described herein are not in any way how sanity or insanity work in real life. Mental illness in the real world is almost exclusively caused by a mixture of genetics and environmental effects. The author has done his utmost to give a pretty realistic, interesting and harsh view on mental illness and insanity. Still, take all here with a grain of salt and respect that your local mentally ill are definitely not that way just because they failed a Will check somewhere, and are most likely not murderous followers of some ancient evil.


-- The San Score --


 Every character begins play with a San score of 100 + Willx10. So a character with +2 Will would start with 120 San, and someone with -2 Will with 80 San. You can never start with less than 80 San. As you live your life, it's quite likely that you will lose some (or all) of that San, which has various effects depending on severity. You are said to be either mildly, moderately, severely, very severely or extremely insane, depending on your San level:

90-70: Mildly Insane
69-50: Moderately Insane
49-20: Severely Insane
19-10: Very Severely Insane
9>: Extremely insane

 Someone mildly insane may just qualify for the term "odd". He might be a little weird sometimes, but can function normally in society and isn't much of a danger or nuisance. 
 A moderately insane person has some difficulties functioning in society, but usually can still hold a normal job and at least somewhat functional relationships. 
 A severely insane person has extreme difficulty functioning in normal society, if he can even hold a regular job, he will probably be very weird and a loner. 
 A very severely insane character can hardly function at all, he surely cannot hold a steady job nor any form of interpersonal relationship. Such a person may be very offputting or even dangerous. 
 An extremely insane character cannot function AT ALL. If no one takes care of the poor son of a bitch he will likely starve or kill himself relatively quickly.
 If San ever reaches 0 or lower, a character's mind has been completely shattered. If something such as a spell or eldritch horror caused this final snap, he may begin to worship the entity or similar, depending on the effect. Otherwise, he commits suicide immediately. If a character should survive reaching 0 San, he sadly is so far gone that no known method can restore his San ever again, he is permanently insane. There are rumors that some powerful magic can cure even this level of insanity, but no such methods are known.


-- Losing San --


 There are three main things that can cause San loss: Trauma, poisons/diseases and supernatural effects. Whenever a character is exposed to an effect that could cause San loss, he must make a so called "San Check", which is denoted for example as follows:

1d6San+20S12

 The die (in this case 1d6) determines how much San the character is at risk of losing. The number with the + (It can also be a negative number) is a factor that determines how likely it is San will be lost, as will be explained in a moment. The S stands for 'Severe', as in Severely Insane. The other possible letters are Mi (for Mild) Mo (For Moderate), S (for severe), VS (For Very Severe) and E (for Extreme). If a character has an insanity level that is equal or worse than this, he is immune to this effect. The final number (in this case 12) is the SN of the Will roll a character must succeed to resist the effect.

 Losing sanity therefor follows this process:

 - Determine if your sanity is equal or below the level listed. If it is, you are immune and need not roll.
 - Roll Will vs the SN listed. On a success, you resist the sanity loss. On a failure, you risk losing sanity. A nat 1 on this roll doubles the sanity you may lose.
 - Roll 1d(Your Max Sanity) vs your San+The number listed. If you roll BELOW your current sanity, you lose the sanity listed (This means that it becomes more and more difficult to become more insane). Otherwise, you lose nothing. 
 - It is worth noting down where and why your character lost San points, to help determine what insanities he may develop

 For example: The slightly unhinged magician Aris is trying to find his way home through a dark, haunted forest, alone. Aris has Will+5, a max San of 150 and current San 86. He is therefor mildly insane, he occasionally zones out and has a mild phobia of spiders. Already on bitter edge due to the entire situation, he is ambushed by a terrible eldritch creature, a Dream Eater. The Dream Eater has an aura of fear that causes 1d4San-10Mo15 loss. Aris therefor must roll against SN 15 to resist the effects of the nightmare creature on his sanity. He is not immune to the effect, since his sanity level is Mild, above the Moderate the Dream Eater's fear aura targets. He rolls an 8 on his Will roll, failing. He must now roll a d150 versus 76 (his San-10). He rolls a 43, not very lucky, failing again. He now rolls 1d4, rolling a 2, and deducts that amount from his San. He now has 84 San and is still mildly insane. If he had succeeded at his Will roll, had rolled 76 or higher on the d150 or already had 69 San or less, he would have not lost anything. The dread aura of the creature sinks in on Aris' mind, leaving him a bit shaken, but he quickly expells those feelings as he readies his weapon and with a shout and crackling thunderbolt begins the battle.


 Some effects are so mindbending they can cause permanent San loss. Such effects are denoted with a 'P' at the end of the San roll (e.g. 5d20San+50E35P might be what happens if you meet Cthulhu face to face). If you lose San to such an effect, you can NEVER recover that San! Reduce your maximum San by that amount, in addition to losing San as normal. There is no known way to cure permanent San loss. Such effects are extremely rare, luckily.
 Usually, a single source of San loss can only affect a character once in his lifetime. Once you've seen a few walking dead it isn't THAT big of a deal anymore. Some events though are so harrowing that they never lose their punch, sometimes even causing continuous San checks over time. Those are marked by /timeinterval. For example, you might be facing 10d20San+100E45P/round when meeting Yogg-Sothoth!


- Trauma -

 The most obvious cause of San loss are traumatic events. Typically, a certain type of traumatic event can only cause a character one San check in their life, but some you never get used to. Most insanities caused by such effects are related to stress, depression or fear. Some example traumatic events you might face in your life that could cause you San loss and their checks include:


Traumatic Event				San Check
Being Surprised by an Unknown Monster	1d4San-20Mi10	
Casting an Unknown Spell		1d4SanMi10
Seeing a Living Dead			1d4SanMi12
Seeing a Living Dead Rise		1d6SanMi12
Knowingly Eating Human Flesh		1d4SanMi15
Witnessing Necromantic Magic		1d4SanMi15
Suffering a Grievous Injury		1d4San-10Mi10
Seeing a Demon				1d8San+10Mi17
Seeing a Huge Head Fall from the Sky	1d6San+20Mi20
Casting Necromantic Magic		1d4SanMo10
Suffering an Amputation*		1d8San+10Mo15
Suffering a Great Personal Loss*	1d8SanMi15
Witnessing a Dear Friend Gorily Killed*	1d12SanMo20
Being Possessed*			1d6SanMo15
Being Tortured*				1d4SanS20
Witnessing an Eldritch Horror		1d20San+30S22
Coming Back From the Dead*		1d20SanS22P
Contacting an Eldritch Horror*		3d20San+30VS25P+
Learning the Truth of the Universe	100d100San+200E55P+

*No matter how often you experience such an event, you must always roll San each time it occurs.


 Note that the first time you cast a spell, you must always roll San! Magic is dangerous for the mind. Some evil or powerful spells even can cause San loss each time they are used, as explained in their description.
 Not all traumas are alike. Some don't bother veterans, some never let you go, so when designing a San Check for a certain situation, keep the following in mind: A high San loss die means that the event is likely to snap someone from sane to insane very quickly. A high San roll modifier means that the event is likely to affect even those already used to pretty insane stuff. A high severity means that the event is something that can really break a character, not just bother them. A high Will SN means that it is hard to ignore, likely to affect a character not already totally immune to it.
 Danger or fear doesn't equate San loss necessarily, but the two tend to compliment each other. San loss events should be only for truly disturbing events FOR THAT CHARACTER. If someone has heard about undead a hundred times and seen pictures and so on, he is unlikely to lose sanity over seeing them. He might be afraid when seeing them, though. On the other hand, very mundane situations can cost one a good chunk of sanity. A heartbreaking romantic breakup could easily cause some characters San loss (But others none at all)! But probably wouldn't lower one's sanity far beyond a regular depression (Unlikely to start hearing demonic voices because your girlfriend left you!).
 In general, San loss should be a rare event in adventures that aren't clearly horror or insanity themed. 


- Poison and Injury -

 In addition to traumatic events, some poisons (such as Ergot, Fly Agaric or Mercury) can cause San loss. Unlike traumatic events, you can't "get used to" a poison, since they actually damage the brain, and as such they don't list a severity. If you are exposed to enough Mercury, you'll fall catatonic eventually (but probably die before that happens anyways)! Whenever you fail a resist roll to such a poison that lists San damage, you take that San damage as listed, no matter your Will or current San. Unless the damage is marked as permanent, though, you immediately recover all San lost to a poison once the effects of the poison have worn off and recovered (e.g. Ergot deals Vit and San damage. Once you recover all lost Vit, your San lost to the Ergot recovers as well). Some poisons though, such as Mercury, permanently damage the brain, and cause permanent San loss!

 Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) can also cause irreparable damage. Whenever you lose Int, but NOT when you temporarily lose Will, your San lowers by 10 per lost point of Int. This can lower you into worse insanities, but once you are below 6 Int, you cannot speak anyways. This recovers as your Int does. In addition, if your skull is ever crippled by an attack, you immediately lose 1d20 San unless you succeed on a Vit roll versus SN 20. This San recovers on it's own at a rate of 1 per month, and cannot be quickened otherwise.


- Supernatural Effects -

 Some creatures, spells or other effects can cause San loss, from mild to devastating. Read their individual descriptions for how they work.



-- Effects of Loss of San --

 The first time a character reaches mild insanity, he must select a "major insanity" and one "minor insanity". The major insanity will be the primary burden on his mind, and will continue to worsen as his San decreases, and possibly someday ending his life. Add this major insanity to your character's sheet as a Flaw. 
 A "minor insanity" is a single flaw that gives the character another odd and sometimes detrimental trait, but they do not worsen over time, they only multiply.
 Each time a character crosses from one threshhold of insanity to the next, his major insanity becomes worse. In addition, he acquires a new minor insanity each time he drops a level. A player must select one or more appropriate insanity Flaws for his character. This decision cannot be changed later. Unless otherwise noted, higher tiers of the same insanity include the effects of the lower ones.
 Mental illnesses (or insanities) are grouped by what caused them and how they function. Traumatic but mundane events tend to cause deppression, anxiety or mania. Traumatic and violent events tend to cause stress disorders, mania or anxiety. Bizarre events, poisons, injury and supernatural effects tend to cause schizophrenic disorders.


- Major Insanities -

 Every even slightly insane character has one major insanity, which automatically worsens as he loses sanity. Pick one from the list below, and add it your character's flaws in addition to it's severity. Note that many effects, especially if the disease is only mild, are up to you to roleplay convincingly!


- Depression -

 True clinical deppression is a lot more complex and severe than your run of the mill blue day. It is marked by chronic fatigue, loss of will to do anything, especially pleasurable things, excessive guilt and thoughts of dark or suicidal topics. Depressed people isolate themselves from the outside world, exaggerating their own condition as a result, and sadly often meet an untimely end in suicide. This condition is most similar to the real life diagnosis of clinical depression.


 Mild: You often feel excessively sad or guilty for things in the past, or for no reason in particular. These feelings tend to visit you a few times a week, sometimes for a few hours at a time, but generally pass.

 Moderate: Feelings of melancholy and guilt are ever present for you. You have great difficulties enjoying things, even things you used to love, but you can still do so on a good day. Whenever you try to convince someone you are very happy, you must roll a SN 10 Will roll to pull it off convincingly. In addition, whenever you see an ally fall below half HP in your presence, you must roll Will against SN 10 or become shaken for the rest of the encounter, blaming yourself for the event.

 Severe: The feelings of guilt, doubt and self hate are starting to become overwhelming. At the beginning of each day, you must make a Will roll SN 15 to do ANYTHING. If you fail this roll, you cannot go to work and spend the entire day doing nothing but the absolute bare necessities to stay alive. In addition, you have a permanent -2 on all attack rolls and AC due to being distracted in combat, and your roll to resist becoming shaken when witnessing an ally injured increases to SN 15.

 Very Severe: Not only are you chronically downtrodden, you have begun to question your validity in being alive. Your roll to do anything in a day increases to SN 20, and your penalties in combat increase to -4 and SN 20, respectively. If you fail the roll to do anything in a day 5 times in a row, you must attempt an additional SN 10 Will roll. On a failure, you try your best to kill yourself. If you fail the attempt or cannot manage it within one hour, you return to doing nothing until you fail 5 times in a row again.

 Extreme: Your brain has become hopelessly overwhelmed with sadness. You cannot do anything other than lay around or eat (but not get or prepare food). If no one brings you food, you starve yourself to death. If you are attacked, you do not fight back. Every day you must succeed at a SN 15 Will roll to resist attempting suicide.


- Anxiety -

 Anxiety disorders manifest when the brain's fear response system malfunctions, causing the poor victim to often become extremely frightened by otherwise mundane or even happy situation. This quickly leads to isolation, and can sometimes cause outbursts of mild violence, and may end in suicide. This condition is a hodgepoge of real life anxiety conditions.


 Mild: You get twitchy and anxious when around lots of people or in dangerous situations. You tend to err a bit on the side of caution in sticky situations. You may also have a phobia to some mundane thing (such as heights or spiders), but nothing severe enough to impede normal functioning.

 Moderate: You have difficulties functioning in stressing environments. Whenever you are subjected to stress (including combat), you must roll Will versus SN 10 or become shaken for the duration of the event. On a nat 1, you suffer a panic attack, you become frightened and attempt to flee from the stress. You remain frightened until you escape the situation and for 1d10 minutes afterwards.

 Severe: Panic attacks have started to become a regular event for you. Your Will SN to resist becoming shaken increases to 15, and each time you fail it, you must roll another Will roll against SN 10 or suffer a panic attack.

 Very Severe: The world is becoming too much for you and you find yourself overwhelmed with fear and anxiety almost constantly. You are perpetually shakened, and each time you are subjected to stress, you must roll Will versus SN 15 or become panicked. You must reroll this every minute a stressful situation remains.

 Extreme: You are in perpetual agonizing terror. You are treated as always frightened, and are unable to sleep unless reduced to 0 FP. Even then you will resist trying to sleep. You are likely to get yourself killed relatively quickly unless contained.


- Mania -

 Mania is a condition of excessive euphoria and energy. What at first sounds like a great thing quickly turns into a nightmare in practice as sufferers start to lose control over their actions and do increasingly dangerous things, sometimes ending in very gruesome ends, or at the very least an extended prison stay. This condition is a mixture of the real life conditions Unipolar Bipolar Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder and ADHD.


 Mild: You just sometimes feel so god damn awesome. The day is fucking awesome, these flowers look fucking awesome, this battle is going fucking awesome. Damn you could kill all these goblins single handedly, no problem! You sometimes suffer mild surges of great energy, happiness and confidence. While it can be annoying, it actually can be quite endearing. But also dangerous if you are not careful.

 Moderate: Your surges are starting to make you addicted to action. Whenever you have to flee from combat or another stressful event in which you are not in direct mortal danger, you must roll Will versus SN 10 to do so. Otherwise, you continue the dangerous action to the best of your ability. You may reroll once per round. In addition, your recklessness lowers your Re AC bonus by 1.

 Severe: Your once endearing or even inspiring manic surges are becoming incredibly offputting and dangerous. Whenever you are insulted, challenged or even angered in even the slightest way, you must succeed at a SN 10 Will roll to not immediately answer what annoyed you with extreme anger, possibly violently. This can cause you to easily beat up a close friend only over him making fun of your hair.

 Very Severe: You are constantly on edge, and believe yourself to be a god amongst men. You will not allow anyone to convince you you are not the most amazing at absolutely everything, and will answer any insult with violence. In addition, every day you must roll Will versus SN 10. On a failure, you must pick trouble somehow, if getting into a screaming match with your fiance, beating up some local hobo or going out monster hunting, whatever is the most convenient.

 Extreme: You cannot sit still and constantly seek stimulation. You believe yourself to be literally immortal and will not back down from ANY threat. Every day you will try to get into as much trouble as you can, preferably violent trouble. Needless to say your predicted lifespan is rather short.


- Stress Disorder -

 Most commonly found in soldiers, when a person has been exposed to too much violence and fighting in their life, it can have permanent effects on the brain and cause it to revert into brutal fighting regimes at wrong times. This is a bastardisation of the real life condition Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.


 Mild: You always seem sort of tense, as if expecting a monster to jump out at any time. You might make a habit of carrying around a weapon wherever you go. You can ignore the urges for the most part, but you still like to have an eye on the door, just in case.

 Moderate: You are always on edge, constantly alert for danger. While this can surely be useful in some situations, it can be very draining and alienate you from other people. It also makes you prone to inappropriate responses to innocent situations. Once per day, when in a safe situation, roll Will versus SN 10. On a failure, you react as if there were a life threatening danger present, and continue to do so for 1d10 rounds. Afterwards, you are shaken for 1d20 minutes.

 Severe: Too many battles have unlearned your body how to relax. Due to the severe muscle tension, you suffer chronic moderate pain. In addition, whenever a situation becomes tense, such as a back ally deal starting to go bad, you must roll Will versus SN 10 to resist immediately reacting to the situation with as much violence and force as you can muster. You are then shaken for the rest of the day if this occurs.

 Very Severe: Danger lies everywhere, and you are prone to jump to a weapon at even the slightest sound. You carry weapons around wherever you go, and probably constantly wear armor. Whenever faced with a situation where violence could solve the problem, you must roll Will against SN 15 to resist solving it that way immediately. In addition, the SN to resist misidentifying a harmless situation as threatening increases to 15, and such a roll must be done once per hour.

 Extreme: You go on a rampage or, failing that, barricade yourself within your home. You attack anything that moves to the best of your ability and do not let up until either it or you are dead. 


- Paranoid Schizophrenia -

 A somewhat strange disease, sufferers have bizarre symptoms such as hearing phantom voices, often criticising them, making fun of them or giving them self destructive orders, seeing colorful shapes, being excessively paranoid of other people's intentions and having strong emotional detachement. Accurately simulating this diverse condition in game terms proved difficult, so it is somewhat simplified.


 Mild: You are a bit distant from people, and a bit paranoid about their intentions. You may have some odd habits, maybe you occasionally talk to yourself, but normally are pleasant enough and can still function.

 Moderate: You occasionally hear quiet whispers that tell you things about what others around you are planning. You're pretty sure they aren't real, but they can get very annoying, and you can easily get paranoid about people around you. In combat and other stressful situations, they become louder and more distracting, giving you -2 to all Dex and Int based rolls for the duration. You definitely start acting a bit weird, but it may be the fun kind of weird.

 Severe: The voices have become more distinct, and their predictions are starting to become true more and more often. Whenever faced with a situation where you must trust someone else, even if it's just a map they gave you, you must roll Will against SN 5. On a failure, you assume they are lying to your face and act accordingly. In addition, the voices become so distracting that the -2 to Dex and Int becomes chronic. Whenever faced with a stressful situation such as combat, each round you must roll Will against SN 5+1 per previous succesful roll. On a failure, you are treated as confused for that round. Failing a roll resets the SN.

 Very Severe: They are all out to kill you, and you know it. The voices were right all along, they know what's best for you, and you want to obey them. Whenever interacting with any person you are not intimately familiar with, you must roll Will against SN 10 once per 10 minutes. On a failure, you fly into a rage and try to hinder whatever the person is currently doing, and then flee. A close friend or family member can calm you down if you succeed at a SN 15 Will check, otherwise you remain convinced they tried to kill you and you were just defending yourself. Strangers cannot calm you down at all unless they use Psychology.

 Extreme: The voices told you they are listening, all the time. They're in the walls, in the ground, under your skin, everywhere. And now the voices are telling you to kill. You cannot do anything but board yourself up in your house and leer angrily at the door without help, and you immediately yell at and attack anyone you are not familiar with that comes near you. Every day, roll Will versus SN 5+1 per previous succeeded roll. On a failure, you attempt suicide, but do not give up even if you fail within an hour. You remain determined until you succeed.


- Delusional Schizophrenia -

 Some schizophrenics do not hear voices or have hallucinations, instead they are just...really fucking weird. These people often exhibit very poor social skills, being loud, obnoxious and always insist on being right. Their most distinctive feature is having extraordinarily weird beliefs that no one can talk them out of. This is not recognized as a seperate condition from paranoid schizophrenia in real life, but should be.
 

 Mild: You tend to be a bit ungraceful in social situations, often insisting you are right a bit more than necessary. You also definitely hold one or another strange belief, but otherwise are relatively normal.

 Moderate: You believe one or a few very weird things (e.g. "There are ghosts in the walls listening to us") and will not allow anyone to tell you anything else. Whenever you are presented with information that conflicts with your belief, you must roll Will against SN 10. On a failure, you reject the information. Even on a success, you only modify your belief just barely to make the new information fit. The convincingness of the information has no effect on your chance of accepting it. In addition, you are quite clumsy both in social situations and in general, suffering -2 on Dex based rolls.

 Severe: You hold tightly onto some odd and debilitating delusion (Such as "As long as I wear a purple shirt, I don't need armor"). This delusion often hinders you in every day life, but you will never take any proof to prove it false. You can be convinced to slightly alter your belief to accept new information, but only if the proof is very good and you succeed at a SN 15 Will check. Otherwise, you follow your belief completely, and may become very unruly when contradicted.

 Very Severe: Your delusions have metamorphed into a complex system of beliefs and rituals that you cannot break. You will act extraordinarily oddly (e.g. wearing heavy chains so you don't "float off into space"), and spend almost all of your time performing some bizarre tasks to satisfy your beliefs. Whenever required to do anything that doesn't directly fit into your version of reality, you must succeed at a SN 15 Will check to do so. Otherwise, you continue to do your rituals, probably talking to yourself the whole while. You vehemently deny any people that disagree with your beliefs, and will debate them (loudly) for hours on why you are right.

 Extreme: You have been completely lost to some alien fantasy world with nonsensical rules and concepts. You blabber to yourself or anyone nearby constantly about incomprehensible things, and must succeed at a SN 15 Will check to even respond to the simplest of situations in a somewhat logical way. In addition, you manifest a killing delusion that commands you to either kill others, or yourself, possibly in highly ritualistic fashions. You will work to achieve such killings to the best of your ability, which could take awhile if the "conditions" are sufficiently complex.



- Epileptoid Schizophrenia -

 Some lunatics are not so chronically damaged as others, but instead have "surges" of insanity, often including wild mood swings and bizarre hallucinations. Some may feel like they shift into an alternate alien world temporarily, others may think they are contacted by god or something similar, and many will simply find themselves utterly insane. This is a fantasy mix of the real world conditions schizophrenia, ADD and temporal lobe epilepsy, amongst others.


 Mild: For the most part, you are an alert, intelligent person, though with some definite slight oddities. Occasionally though, you seem to "phase out" of reality, becoming detached and staring off into the distance, or momentarily reacting weirdly to the situation at hand. You snap out of it quite quickly though, and while a bit confused afterwards can function fine.

 Moderate: Your shifts have started to become more frequent and extreme. Once per hour out of combat, roll Will vs SN 10. On a failure, you are dazed for 1d4 minutes. In combat or other highly stressful situations, you must roll at the beginning, and once every minute afterwards, on a failure you are dazed for 1d2 rounds. Beyond that, you begin mildly hallucinating, usually oddly colored moving patterns and shapes, though sometimes you also hear whispering voices. These distract you and make seeing difficult, giving you a -2 to Dex and Int based rolls while in combat.

 Severe: The colors and shapes are slowly turning more and more into figures and patterns, perhaps even communicating with you, and sometimes frightening or distracting you. The SN to resist becoming dazed increases to SN 15, and if you fail such a roll twice in a roll, you become confused instead of dazed. The hallucinations worsen dramatically, making it hard for you to see and perceive the world, giving you a -4 to Per.

 Very Severe: You seem to be constantly flipping between the here and wherever else there is. You must roll to resist becoming dazed or confused out of combat every 10 minutes, and in combat every round. Your behavior by now has completely deterioated into obvious lunacy, seemingly talking to invisible people, only to suddenly be present again for a few minutes, and then zoning back out to yell at unseen ghosts. You may begin hearing clear voices that give you commands, and you are likely to follow those while confused. Your penalty to Per increases to -6.

 Extreme: You are permanently caught in a bizarre nightmarescape. Wherever you look you see twisting shadows, ghostly colors and alien creatures. You are permanently confused, caught in a hellish world without rules from which you cannot escape. You may be dangerous if you mistake others for monsters, but will probably spend most of your time crying in a corner or gibbering to yourself. You cannot feed yourself, and starve if not taken care of. It is also likely you may decide to commit suicide at some time or another.


- Minor Insanities -

 No two madmen are alike. Therefor, each time you fall a level in sanity, you gain an additional "mild insanity". These have weaker effects than major insanities, and are mostly things that the player is urged to roleplay.
 Some minor insanities have multiple levels of severity. These do not automatically worsen as the character loses San, instead, he may decide to select the same minor insanity multiple times, increasing it's severity by one step each time he does. Unless otherwise noted, higher tiers of minor insanities include the effects of lower tiers.

 Example: Aris the mage, when first reaching Mild Insanity, selected the major insanity "Epileptoid Schizophrenia" to complement his arcane insanity, and the minor insanity "Phobia (Spiders, Mild)". Once he falls to Moderate insanity, his Epileptoid Schizophrenia worsens from Mild to Moderate, and he must select a new minor insanity. He could select a new one, or he may increase his Phobia (Spiders, Mild) to Phobia (Spiders, Moderate).

 While one may be tempted to select insanities that are the least detrimental to a character, it is sometimes fun and interesting to select true flaws that may inconvenience a character, consider what would fit your story best!
 In addition to the minor insanities listed here, the Mild version of every major insanity can be selected in place of a minor insanity. This mild version of a major insanity does not increase in severity unless you select it multiple times.


- Phobia (Mild, Moderate, Severe) -

 You are deathly afraid of some otherwise mostly or totally harmless thing. Common phobias include the dark, spiders, heights, water or being alone. Whenever you are faced with your phobia, you must roll a Will roll vs SN 8, 12 or 15 (for Mild, Moderate and Severe phobias respectively) or become shaken, frightened or panicked (for Mild, Moderate and Severe phobias respectively) as long as you can perceive what is causing your phobia. On a succesful roll, you overcome your fear of this instance of your fear. For example, if you had a phobia of spiders, and were ambushed by a group of giant arachnids, you would have to roll phobia. On a success, you would overcome your fear of these spiders, but if you meet more later that day, you would need to roll again! For fear of a situation, such as the dark or heights, roll when first confronted with the fear, and then again once every 10 minutes it persists. In addition, if your fear would normally provoke Sanity loss, you take a -5 to Will to resist it.
 This insanity most commonly coexists with anxiety and stress disorders. You may have more than one phobia.


- Phantom Voices (Whispering, Distracting, Diabolic) -

 You hear disembodied voices. Whispering Phantom Voices are mostly harmless, you occasionally hear a slight whisper that may parrot what you or someone else is saying, give you (usually bad) advice on your current situation, or just say something completely nonsensical. This is still somewhat distracting, giving you a -1 to all Int rolls that require concentration, such as spellcasting, and to Per.
 Distracting voices are far more distinct, and can form whole sentences. They often comment on your actions, usually in a very demeaning fashion, and can sometimes even startle or frighten you. You take a -2 to all Int rolls that require concentration and to Per, and in addition, every time you enter combat or another stressful situation, you must roll Will vs SN 10, or be startled by suddenly loud voices, making you shaken for 1d6 rounds.
 Diabolic voices are loud, persistent and unmistakibly EVIL. They urge you to kill, rape, burn or do other such terrible things. While you can resist their suggestions, they can distract you, frighten you and even drown out other things around you. You take a -4 to Per due to this, and at the beginning of any combat, must roll Will against SN 15 or "freeze" for the first round (treat as dazed), fighting back the voices. This is in addition to the roll to resist becoming shaken.
 This most often coexists with schizophrenic type major insanities, but also occasionally with deppression or stress disorder.


- Hallucinations (Mild, Moderate, Severe) -

 You see things that aren't present. For the most part, they are just nondescript blobs of color that weakly lay over your perception, but occasionally they can be very distracting. Mild hallucinations give you -2 to Per.
 Moderate hallucinations can occasionally be confused with real objects, but mostly just remain a nuisance, giving you -3 to Per and -1 to MAB and RAB.
 Severe hallucinations have started to block your normal senses completely, giving you -4 to Per and -2 to MAB and RAB. In addition, against enemies you attack with a ranged weapon, you have a 10% concealment miss chance due to hallucinations disrupting your sight.
 This most often coexists with schizophrenic conditions.


- Delusion -

 You hold one very odd belief, such as "Dirt is a good spice", "Hanging a dead pig from my door will protect from thieves" or "Chimneys are overrated". While mostly harmless, this belief can be annoying to others, and sometimes cause minor damage. You truly hold on to this belief no matter what, and even if given incredibly obvious proof that it is false, will reject it if there is even the slightest off chance the proof may be falsified. Needless to say, it's usually useless to talk to you about your delusion, and it's better usually to just leave you to it.
 This condition most often coexists with delusional schizophrenia (obviously) and anxiety conditions.


- Compulsion (Mild, Moderate, Severe) -
 
 You have strong compulsions to perform some form of weird action, and become very nervous and anxious if you do not perform it. Think of some appropriate ritual, such as having to open and close a door 3 times after going through it, never stepping on cracks, or washing your hands every hour. Whenever you go at least an hour without doing your ritual, you must roll Will against SN 10, 15 or 20 (according to severity) or perform that ritual, even if it is very inappropriate to do at the time! You might even start washing your hands mid battle! If you cannot perform the ritual, you become very anxious until you can, treat as shaken, or frightened if your compulsion is severe.
 This most often coexists with anxiety or delusional schizophrenia.


- Obsession -

 You are unusually obsessed with some weird thing. You cannot select something mundane such as work, appropriate choices would include numbers, rocks or worms. You become anxious when not able to partake in your favorite activity, and gladly spend hours and hours playing repetetively with your obsession. If you go more than a day without indulging in your obsession, you become shaken until you can do so again for at least an hour.



-- Treating Insanity --


 Yes they might have put you into a straightjacket. Yes they may be injetnig you with some weird fluids. Sure, they may also be strangely fascinated with your mother. But hey, it's all just with the goal of helping you! Probably...

 Living life isn't easy. Living life in a dangerous frontier town is probably harder. Living life in a frontier town constantly marked by death and disaster and stalked by horrific eldritch creatures that were not meant to be, is just a tad even worse. It's quite possible that a character will lose quite a bit of sanity over the course of his life, but luckily, it is possible to regain some or all of it. An insane character will probably be well advised to search for help for his predicament, and so will probably be his friends and colleages as well, before he starts hurting himself or others. 
 There are three main ways to treat insanity: Rest, psychotherapy and medication. In addition, magic can present a fourth option, if it is available.
 Sadly, the more insane one becomes, the harder it becomes to treat. In general, rest and psychotherapy are good to take care of milder insanities, while more severe ones usually require strong medication or magic to deal with. 

- Rest -

 The brain is remarkably durable, and can slowly recover from all but the worst of traumas. For every week a character is free of traumatizing events (such as combat, death or poverty), he regains 1 San as long as his current sanity is above Severe.
 This can be supplemented with appropriate good conditions. If a character is removed from his normal, stressful life, for an extended period of time, such as by going on a vacation, he recovers sanity faster. He recovers one additional point per week for each of the following criteria met:

-Setting is very different from home
-Setting is unusually relaxing and beautiful
-Accompanied by a loved one or true friend

 Enough rest can allow a character to regenerate his San up to his maximum, as long as he wasn't Severely or worse insane to begin. For such people, or people that cannot avoid stress, other methods are needed.


- Psychotherapy -

 When things become too terrible, it may be necessary to gain the help of a trained psychologist to help you sort out your mess of a brain. Psychotherapy tends to work well for deppression, anxiety and stress conditions, but very poorly on schizophrenics. A psychologist can treat Severely or even Very Severely insane patients, but it is very difficult and can take a long time.
 A succesful psychologist can greatly increase the rate at which you gain sanity...but can also use their knowledge to make things much, much worse. Oh, nevermind that part, that was just paranoid talk, no psychologist would ever do that, right?

 See the Psychology skill for more information.


- Medication -

 For some, especially severely insane, people, medication that directly acts on the brain may be their best, or only, option to deal with the enroaching darkness of madness. There are many different types of psychiatric medicines, many very addictive, with potent side effects or worse. As such, experimenting with such drugs can be very dangerous, especially considering one's possible low sanity. Usually, it is best for a trained psychologist or psychiatrist to overlook such drug usage, but sometimes you gotta improvise, you know?
 Most psychiatric drugs do not cure sanity, only temporarily suppress issues relating to it. In addition, many are expensive and hard to produce. And a very insane character may be dependant on a regular supply, who knows what he might do without?


- Anxiolytics -

 An anxiolytic is a drug that suppresses anxiety and fear. These drugs usually have a very pleasant, dulling high to them, and are almost universally addictive. They can be a huge boon to anxiety plagued characters, but are also sometimes (ab)used by healthy people to get the high.
 A typical anxiolytic, if taken, immediately ends any fear or anxiety effect currently affecting the character. In addition, as long as it isn't more than one dose, it can give one a steady hand and aim, giving a character +1 RAB while it lasts (Usually 2d6 hours). While it lasts, a character also has +2 against further fear effects. He may also take another dose to negate another fear effect, but risks more severe side effects.
 While under the effect of an anxiolytic, a character suffering from anxiety or stress disorder is treated as being only mildly insane for purpose of his major insanity. If he is Very Severely or Extremely Insane though, he requires a dose every HOUR.
 Anxiolytics are addictive. Usually, they are moderately addictive, though more potent types are strongly addictive and build tolerance. See addiction for how this works [TO DO].
 When taking more than one anxiolytic within a day, a character must roll Fort against SN 10 + (2 per dose taken). On a failure, the character becomes drowsy for the rest of the day. If he takes another dose, he immediately falls asleep for 1d4 hours. This can also be used to drug and tranquilise other people purposefully.

 A typical Anxiolytic would be Valium or Xanax. Alcohol too has anxiolytic properties, but functions differently. Lorazepam is an example of a powerful anxiolytic, functioning as equivalent of four doses of Valium. 

- Anti Depressants -

 Anti Depressants, as the name implies, are drugs designed to suppress depression and lift the mood. Sadly, this isn't as simple as one might think, since just straight up using mood lifters (such as Cocain) can be extremely harmful. As such, anti depressants usually do not make you "high", and often have some very uncomfortable side effects.
 A depressed patient needs 1 dose of anti depressant per day to get it's affect. He must take the drug for one whole week before he starts seeing effects. At the end of the week, he rolls Vit against SN 10. On a success, the drug works for him. On a critical success, it works on him with no side effects. On a failure, his body rejects the drug, and he must try a new one. On a critical failure, he suffers Serotonin Syndrome.
 If the patient's body accepts the anti depressant, taking one dose a day reduces the effects of his depression to the Mild level, or Moderate if he was Very Severely or Extremely insane. Taking two doses reduces even Very Severely or Extremely insane patient to Mild insanity, but gives the patient -4 to Fort to resist side effects.
 Each day he takes an anti depressant the patient must roll Fort against SN 10. On a failure, he suffers side effects. He has extreme discomfort throughout his whole body, feeling wrong inside his skin, often starting to scratch uncontrollably, and is often extremely tired. He loses half his FP for that day that he cannot recover until the next day, and suffers the Itching condition for the day. If he critically fails the roll to resist side effects, he suffers Serotonin Syndrome.
 If a patient has rejected a certain anti depressant but is given it anyways, his depression WORSENS by one step, and he suffers side effects every day. He must also roll Fort again SN 5 every day to resist Serotonin Syndrome.
 If given to a patient that does not have depression, he must roll Fort against SN 10 immediately or lose 1d6 San, and the must roll Fort against SN 5 or suffer Serotonin Syndrome.
 Serotonin Syndrome is a terrible and feared complication that can appear when taking Anti Depressants wrongly. A character that suffers Serotonin Syndrome goes into a kind of neurological shock, treat as seizure, for 1d4 hours. He is at 1/3 of max FP on awakening, and loses 1d6 HP. In addition, he must roll Vit against SN 5. On a failure, he permanently loses 1 Int to brain damage. The only way to prevent Serotonin Syndrome is giving the patient an anti serotonergic agent during the seizure. If such a medicine is avalaible (a strong anti anxiety medication works too), administering such a drug during the seizure awakens the victim, making him lose 1d4 HP and FP and not risking further damage.

 The most accesible anti depressant is derived from the plant St John’s Wort. If correctly prepared (See the Herbalism skill), St John's Wort functions as a typical anti depressant. Note that since anti depressants are often rejected, doctor's will probably need quite a few different anti depressents to help their patients, which is hard since most others are purely synthetic!


- Anti Epileptics -

 This class of drugs suppresses the brain from short circuiting at inoportune times. They are most effective for Mania and Epileptoid Schizophrenia.
 A patient needs one dose a day per level of severity of his Mania or Epileptoid Schizophrenia, and can reduce it to a minimum of Mild. Each dose requires a seperate SN 10 Fort roll to resist side effects.
 Each time side effects occur, a character loses 1d6 FP and takes a cumulative -1 to all Int based checks for that day. On a critical failure against side effects, a character falls unconscious for 1d4 hours and loses 1d6 HP.
 An anti epileptic can also be used to stop a seizure in progress. Giving a character suffering from a seizure of non supernatural origin allows them to immediately recover from it. A character suffering from a seizure of supernatural origin given an anti epileptic may reroll his resist roll with a +4 bonus.
 Anti Epileptics are moderately addictive, and build tolerance.

 The most common modern anti epileptics are the valproate derivatives (very difficult to make in a middle aged setting!). For game purposes, Lithium salts (much easier to get) can be considered an anti epileptic, though it cannot be used to stop seizures in progress. A chemical found in Marijuana, CBD, if extracted from the plant properly (The other parts of the plants encourage seizures!), functions as an anti epileptic that is non addictive and doesn't build tolerance.


- Anti Psychotics -

 The kings amongst psychiatric drugs, anti psychotics make insanity just go away. Kinda. Often just straight up called "tranquilizers", anti psychotics suppress abberant behavior, sometimes saving patients from insanity, and other times just making them into listless zombies.
 A dose of anti psychotics increases one's effect sanity level by one. Each dose though is quite tranquilizing, giving the character -1 to all Str, Dex and Int based rolls per dose for that day.
 For each dose, a character must also roll Fort against SN 10 to resist losing 1d6 FP and suffering an ADDITIONAL -1 to all Str, Dex and Int based rolls. On a critical failure on such a roll, a character loses 1d6 HP and must roll Vit against SN 5 or lose 1 Int and 1 Dex permanently, becoming both slower and slower in the head and beginning to develop parkinson like shaking and bad coordination.
 Anti psychotics are strongly addictive and build tolerance.

 There are many modern anti psychotics, such as Thorazine, Amisulprin or Risperidone. There are no powerful natural anti psychotics known.

To Do: Benefits of insanity, psionics


- Psychology -
Very Hard/Int Trained Only

 You are trained in understanding other's minds, helping them deal with their problems, or manipulating them to your will. You may select an optional speciality in Analysis, Psychotherapy or Brainwashing.

 Analysis: You are capable of figuring out what another character is thinking when asking them the right questions. If you can freely question a character anything you need to for at least 10 minutes, you can attempt to illicit a clue to their intentions. Roll Psychology opposed by the other character's Will. On a success, the other character reveals a truthful clue to whatever you are inquiring on. On a critical success, the hint is unusually clear, but never 100% so. On a failure, you learn nothing, but may reattempt with a cumulative -1 to your roll. On a critical failure, you pick up a vastly false hint! For this to work between PCs, the losing party must truly honestly give a useful hint. For the most part though, this ashould be reserved for NPCs. A hint gained from this skill should never be a clear solution, just a hunch!

 Psychotherapy: You can help another character get over traumatic events and recover sanity quicker than usual. You can give an insane character a "session" once per week, which takes 4 hours. You can give multiple sessions within one week, each one giving you a +1 to your roll for that week, to a maximum of +5. The SN depends on the severity of the insanity your patient suffers from. 

Degree				SN
Mildly				10
Moderately			15
Severely			25
Very Severely			30
Patient is schizophrenic	+5
Patient has depression		-5
Patient has anxiety or stress	-5

 You cannot treat an extremely insane character. On a succesful roll at the end of a week of therapy, the patient rolls a d(his max sanity) against his current sanity. If he rolls below, he recovers 1d6 San. This stacks with San regained from rest. On a failure, nothing happens, but may be reattempted next week. A critical success of the therapist doubles the amount a patient will gain, but only if he succeeds on the San roll.
 A failure on your psychology roll wastes the week. On a critical failure, you blunder and say something wrong that offends or hurts your patient. They must roll a d(patient's max sanity) against their current sanity. If they roll below, they lose 1d4 San. They may also mistrust you from that point forwards.
 In addition, psychotherapy can be not completely safe for the would be therapist as well. In addition to one's patient being possibly dangerous, their insane words can threaten your mind as well. Every week spent treating a Severely or Very Severely insane person, the therapist must make a San check at 1d4SanS10 if their patient is Severely insane, or 1d6San+10VS15 if they are Very Severely insane.
 If a patient is under the influence of psychiatric drugs during each setting, he can be treated as if he were of that degree of insanity, but always only recovers 1 San.


 Brainwashing: You can also twist your knowledge of the human mind for evil purposes. You can pyschologically torture and maime your foes, attempting to drive them insane. This is a long and complex process, and usually requires you to have full control over the subject. You must invest at least 8 hours a week attempting to brainwash a person, in which case you roll against an SN depending on your victims current sanity.


Sanity						SN
None						30
Mildly						25
Moderately					20
Severely					15
Very Severly					10
Extremely					-

Modifier							SN
The subject is imprisoned by you				-10
You torture the subject						-5
You use psychotropic drugs*					-5
The subject trusts you						-5
The subject loves you						-10
You spend more than 4 hours a week alone with the subject	-5
The subject has access to friends or family			+5
You try to hide it is you					+5

* Such as LSD or Magic Mushrooms

 On a succesful check, the subject must make a San check of 1d8SanVS where the Will SN is your Psychology check result. You can insidiously disguise your attempts to undermine the other character's sanity as an attempt to help them, either just by "being their friend" or by pretending to be their therapist. Instead of helping them, you make them dependant on you and trusting of you, and slowly plant doubts and seeds of insanity into their minds. It's a complex and long process, but can be harrowing. Whenever you do such to another character, at the end of the week, they must roll Int vs your Psychology check result. On a failure, they do not realise what you are up to and do not attribute their slowly degrading sanity to your influence. Others that overhear your conversations though, might very well notice and attempt to aid your victim.
