# Neverwhere Sheets

*Neverwhere uses Google Spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/) as a simple and accessible way of storing and presenting data for it's players. These sheets are not yet considered stable for release, and will be added here around the same time the bot source code is, and this should be considered sketchwork.*
