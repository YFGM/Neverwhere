## Neverwhere: What it is, How it is, and Why it is


 Congratulations, you are currently reading the foreword to the beta version of Neverwhere. But what is Neverwhere? What's it all about? How does it work? Who is it for?


### What is Neverwhere? 

 Neverwhere is something of a Pen and Paper (PnP) system, something of a freeform RP game, and something of a strategy video game (For the mega nerds, it has certain MUD like qualities). And yet, Neverwhere tries to be something unique.  
 
 Neverwhere was inspired by possibly the simplest of game ideas ever, one that probably everyone that played pretend as a kid or PnP as an adult has seen before: You and your friends are in some kind of weird fantasy world and need to live there and survive. Ok maybe I was a bit of a weird kid, but one of my favorite scenarios wasn't necessarily fighting off some monster or saving a princess, I often found it really fun to pretend we were building a town or tending to a farm, and occasionally had to protect it against monsters, and maybe unlock cool magic powers along the way. And this system is that simple concept taken to new nerdy height of complexity and refinedness.  
 
 In the game of Neverwhere, you take on the role of a person in a fantasy world, set out into the world and tasked with one thing: Survive. But you won't be able to do it on your own. Like normal PnPs, you will gain powers for your character, fight monsters and gain treasure. Like in an RP game, you will mingle and interact with your fellow players and their characters. Like in a strategy video game, you will have to gather resources, build buildings and organize people and troops.  
 You will truly take on the (possibly short) life of a desperate fantasy character part of a larger community of desperate fantasy characters, struggling to hold off both hunger and the things that lurk in the shadows. Unlike other PnP like games, in Neverwhere, there will be a large pool of players, possibly dozens or even more, that all need to work together to survive in this unforgiving world. 
 
 Most if not all of the game is played over IRC, a form of chat room, in which players and GMs (organizers of the story and world) can communicate and interact. Additionally, a trusty piece of software, a bot, will be at your side to assist you with administering and growing both your own character, and the town he lives in.


### Who is Neverwhere For?

 It has to be made clear from the start that Neverwhere is NOT a game for everyone. As one can easily see from the myriad ways one can be maimed, driven insane or killed in this world, Neverwhere is not for the faint of heart. This game is intended for a mature audience ONLY. It deals with many dark and mature themes such as violence, gore, insanity, drug addiction and math. 
 It is possible to play Neverwhere light hearted, it would only need small changes, but ultimately, it is not what this game was designed to be. This world is meant to be a dark, cold and cruel place, where every day is a bid for survival, and death and tragedy haunt every man's step.
 
 Additionally to the mature themes in game, Neverwhere is not designed with a "casual" audience in mind. Some concepts may be a bit confusing or complex for newcomers (But I promise it's not too bad!), and this game definitely requires some proactivity from it's players. 
 If you simply want a carefree fantasy world where you can hang out with friends or go around, kill monsters and get loot, Neverwhere is not the system for you. If on the other hand, you may want a more challenging and varied PnP experience, that may drive you to your limits on strategic and roleplaying abilities, Neverwhere may be able to give you a more sophisticated and complex experience than you could of had elsewhere.

 As a final note on theme: While this is a mature game with a mature audience in mind, sexual content is strictly frowned upon within Neverwhere. It is my firm belief that such content has it's place, and it isn't in a survival horror game. I do not wish to discriminate against any gender or sexual identity, but I ask you politely to leave such issues at the door, we don't want them at the gaming table. At the gaming table, we are playing a fantasy survival horror game, nothing more, and nothing less.


 **If you are looking for a happy fantasy world of elves and dwarfs, you are in the wrong place. But if you are looking for a game inspired by a mixture of Warhammer, Lovecraft and Dwarf Fortress, boy do I have a treat for you.**


### Welcome to Hell: Playing Neverwhere


 The first step to begin playing Neverwhere is to find a suitable group to join. In the future, the bot will be free and open source, so will the rules, and anyone will be able to make their own Neverwhere world to his liking. But for the sake of beta testing, there will for now only be a limited amount, probably only a single Neverwhere game running at a given time. Since Neverwhere is such a complex system that values large communities and needs heavy preparation to start, it's likely that even once it is released fully that it is usually a better idea to join an already established community.
 
 Once you have found a community to join, the first step is to read the basic rules and create a character. There are many, many rules that are part of Neverwhere, covering a dizzying amount of possible situations. For now, you don't have to know all these rules, but you should definitely read the most basic of rules, in the following order:
* Etiquette and Community Rules
* Rolling Guide
* Character Creation

 Read these documents carefully and try to get an understanding of what kind of character you want to be, and how you want to play him. Then when you have a bit of a grip, you can start making your character as the Character Creation document explains. Don't worry if it isn't perfect right away, you will have plenty of time later to refine and expand your character.
 
 Also consider what role(s) you might want to fill. Every character is expected to have a job, and many will probably want to also be capable fighters. But what do you want to do? Be a powerful adventurer that only does menial work in the quarry during the week? Or maybe you would rather be a wealthy and influential business man? Or the leading town architect? Or just the best cook in town? Neverwhere gives you the chance to fill just about any role there could be in a community, if you so desire. Design your character appropriately, and note that you will probably have to read some extra rules depending on what you want your character to do later on!
 
 Note also that most communities will require you to read the **Job and Crafting Guide** to be allowed to play, so consider that 4th on the list!
 
### Advanced Neverwhere

 Once you have your basics down, and have created your character, you can talk to your local community and get right into the playing. But maybe it could be of interest for you to check out other, more advanced rules and options you will have in Neverwhere. Reading more rules will probably reward you with more interesting ideas for your character, and a better command of the system, which will benefit everyone.
 
 Here are some documents your author recommends reading carefully:
 * Bot User Guide
 * Skills
 * Spellcasting
 * Trade and Work
 * Equipment
 * Civil Engineering
